"Mexican rulers' lower house majority to shrink, results show Mexicans pared back President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's power in elections on Sunday, an official projection based on early results showed, delivering his MORENA party and allies a reduced majority that will make sweeping change more difficult.The National Electoral Institute (INE) saw the ruling coalition winning between 265 and 292 of the 500 seats in the lower house, short of the two thirds majority needed to push through amendments to the constitution.The mid-term election was seen as a referendum on the president's policies and his shake-up of Mexico's institutions.The result, if confirmed, suggests voters want Lopez Obrador to tone down his plans to transform Mexico with an overhaul of politics and the economy. He has also toyed with constitutional changes to protect state energy companies.Since taking office in 2018 after a landslide victory, he has strengthened the role of the state in the energy sector and radically cut back on the cost of government to channel resources to the poor and his priority infrastructure projects.In the process, critics say, he has eroded institutional checks and balances and frequently criticized autonomous bodies, including the Bank of Mexico, prompting adversaries to sound the alarm about his concentration of power.The forecast outcome of the lower house election was in line with opinion polls late in the race, which showed Lopez Obrador's coalition losing some of its grip on the contest after a deadly metro accident in May and sexual abuse allegations against some of its most prominent candidates.Mexicans also chose 15 state governors and state lawmakers on Sunday. Results are still coming in. Opinion polls in recent days showed MORENA winning most of the 15 governors' races.'NOT HAPPY'The contest has taken place amid the COVID-19 pandemic and high levels of violent crime, with 91 politicians killed in this election cycle, according to security consultancy Etellekt.With security forces ramping up their presence in violence-plagued states Baja California, Guerrero, Michoacan and Sonora ahead of the election, crime was a top concern for many voters.In one incident on Sunday, a man threw a severed head at a voting station in the Terrazas del Valle neighborhood of the border city Tijuana as people voted. read more To stay on top in the long term, MORENA must improve its record on crime and the economy, officials, lawmakers and voters say. Mexico's economy contracted 8.5% in 2020, the most since the Great Depression of the 1930s, though it is now clawing back ground, lifted by U.S. demand. read more Olivia Aguirre, a 32-year-old academic in Mexico City who voted for Lopez Obrador in 2012 and 2018, said she was disillusioned with the president for his dismissal of women's protests against various problems including violence, a lack of support for renewable energy and what she called the ""authoritarian"" drift of his government.""I'm not happy about the direction the country is headed,"" she said after voting for the opposition in the city's Roma district.Many of her friends who had supported him felt the same way, though her parents still backed MORENA, she said. Early results pointed to setbacks in the capital for the ruling party.Even so, while voters have been critical of the government's record on job creation and fighting crime, skepticism of Mexico's former rulers, now in opposition, is marked. Lopez Obrador has also benefited from a coronavirus vaccine rollout.  read more The INE projections showed only moderate gains for the opposition coalition despite robust campaigning portraying Lopez Obrador as a danger to democracy.Voter Luis Dominguez, 36, in the small municipality of Cuaxomulco in the southeastern state of Tlaxcala said he was standing by the president.""We have to support him so he can complete his mission,"" said Dominguez.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1

"Thailand starts long awaited COVID-19 vaccination drive Thailand kicked off a long-awaited mass vaccination campaign on Monday as the country battles its third and worst wave of the coronavirus epidemic.The government aims to administer 6 million doses this month, hoping to ease worries over the highly anticipated roll-out and concerns about supply shortages.""The government will ensure that everyone is vaccinated,"" Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said in televised comments after he visited an inoculation centre in Bangkok.There were, however, early hiccups as some vaccine centres registered more than their quota, leading to postponements, senior health official Opas Karnkawinpong told a news conference.""We apologise if your vaccination appointment was postponed, but will make sure you are registered at the earliest,"" Opas said.Hospitals last week delayed vaccinations for nearly 40,000 people, citing a limited supply.  read more Thailand escaped the worst of the coronavirus pandemic as it hit other countries hard last year, but is now grappling with its deadliest outbreak. Officials have scrambled to source more vaccines amid the third wave, which so far accounts for more than 80% of its 179,886 total infections and 1,269 fatalities.Authorities on Monday said 235 cases of the B.1.617.2 variant, which ravaged India, had spread to nine provinces since it was first detected in Bangkok last month.The outbreaks has highlighted criticisms of the country's vaccine programme for an over-reliance on AstraZeneca shots produced by royal-owned Siam Bioscience, a slow roll-out and a confusing registration system.On Monday morning, 986 vaccination centres reported a total of 143,116 people received shots. That adds to 2.8 million people deemed vulnerable, including frontline health and transport workers.""My feeling is that no matter what, we will need to go outside of home for the littlest things, so getting the vaccine gives us a sense of relief,"" said Praepawee Lertpongkijja, 38, at a Bangkok vaccination centre.VACCINE SUPPLIESThe 6 million doses to be administered this month will be a mix of AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and imported Sinovac (SVA.O) vaccines.Concerns were raised last week over local production of the AstraZeneca vaccine by Siam Bioscience's after the Philippines said its order had been reduced and delayed.  read more The health ministry on Monday said it will receive an additional 3.42 million doses from AstraZeneca after mid-June said, did not specify how much would be locally made.It received 1.8 million locally-produced AstraZeneca shots on Friday.

But the minority Hazara neighbourhood where the school is located has repeatedly been targeted by militants.The United States and many other Western nations have touted girls' education as one of the key successes of years of foreign presence in Afghanistan.More than 3.5 million girls are now enrolled in school in the country, according to USAID, compared to none during the Taliban's rule from 1996 to 2001. But an estimated 3.7 million children remain out of school, 60% of them girls, according to UNICEF.Security is deteriorating as foreign forces prepare to leave Afghanistan later this year, emboldening some hard-line Islamist groups to threaten the progress made in girls' education.Fatima's father, 36-year-old Taqi Noori, said he thought about, but decided against, leaving the country.""There is always war in Afghanistan, but what can we do?

"Swiss to vote on whether to become first European nation to ban synthetic pesticides Switzerland could become the first European country to ban artificial pesticides in a June 13 referendum which backers of the initiative hope will trigger similar prohibitions elsewhere.Globally, only Bhutan has a complete ban on synthetic pesticides, according to supporters aiming to outlaw the use of products made by agro-chemical giants such as Switzerland's Syngenta and Germany's Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and BASF (BASFn.DE).Supporters of the ban say the artificial products cause serious health problems and reduce biodiversity. Manufacturers say their pesticides are rigorously tested and regulated, can be used safely and crop yields would slump without them.Another initiative to be voted on the same day aims to improve the quality of Switzerland's drinking water and food by stopping direct subsidies to farmers who use artificial pesticides and antibiotics in livestock.Switzerland has been starkly divided by an unusually bitter debate over the initiatives and the votes look set to be close. A recent Tamedia poll showed 48% of voters favoured the drinking water initiative and 49% supported the pesticide ban.If adopted, the proposals give farmers up to 10 years to make the transition, which would allow Switzerland to become a pioneer in organic food as well as an example to the rest of the world, Swiss wine maker Roland Lenz said.""Clean water, one of the foundations of life, is endangered,"" said Lenz, a 51-year-old organic farmer, whose vineyard is surrounded by farmers opposing the initiative.Syngenta, which is headquartered in Switzerland and owned by China National Chemical Corporation, opposes both initiatives, saying a ban would reduce agricultural yields by up to 40%.""The consequences of not using them are clear: fewer regional products, higher prices, and more imports. This is not in the interest of consumers, nor is it in the interest of the environment,"" a Syngenta spokesman said.LIFE UNDER SIEGEThe clean water initiative also wants farmers to stop using imported animal feed, to restrict the numbers of cows, pigs and chickens in Switzerland along with the manure they produce that can pollute drinking water.""People have been sold a romantic image of farming in Switzerland, which is far removed from reality,"" said Pascal Scheiwiller, a backer of the clean water campaign, which estimates 1 million Swiss people drink contaminated water.The Swiss Farmers Union said many of its members feel their way of life is under siege.""A lot of people in cities think if they have two tomatoes growing on the balcony of their apartment they understand farming,"" said Martin Haab, president of the Zurich Farmers Association.""I look back 200 years ago when we couldn't protect our plants and animals, and we had hunger in Switzerland and all over Europe,"" said Haab.Martin's son Dominic, who runs a dairy farm outside Zurich, said the consequences for the rural economy would be brutal, with local businesses also being hit by a fall in animal numbers to comply with the fodder restrictions.Wine maker Lenz, however, said to continue using pesticides was ""sheer lunacy"", especially when it was possible to use methods such as growing fruit with thicker skins to make them fungus resistant.“With a ‘Yes’ vote on both initiatives, we will finally move from the chemical age back to the organic age,” he said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Analysis: India’s vaccine inequity worsens as countryside languishes Urban Indians are getting COVID-19 shots much faster than the hundreds of millions of people living in the countryside, government data shows, reflecting rising inequity in the nation’s immunisation drive.In 114 of India's least developed districts - collectively home to about 176 million people - authorities have administered just 23 million doses in total.That's the same number of doses as have been administered across nine major cities -- New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Thane and Nagpur -- which combined have half the population of the least developed districts.The disparity was even stronger last month, after the government allowed private sales of vaccines for adults aged under 45 years, an offer which favoured residents of cities with larger private hospital networks. For the first four weeks of May, those nine cities gave 16% more doses than the combined rural districts, data from the government’s Co-WIN vaccination portal shows.""My friends from the city were vaccinated at private hospitals,"" said Atul Pawar, a 38-year-old farmer from Satara, a rural western district of Maharashtra, India's wealthiest state. ""I am ready to pay, but doses are not available and district borders are sealed because of the lockdown.""The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said in a statement on Saturday that reports of vaccine inequity in India were ""inaccurate and speculative in nature"".""Liberalised pricing and accelerated national COVID-19 vaccination strategy ensures vaccine equity,"" it said, adding that smaller cities were also getting doses like the big ones.The ministry said it had asked states with fewer private hospitals to review the status of their vaccination campaigns and encourage some government-empanelled hospitals to strike deals with vaccine companies if need be.India has administered more than 222 million doses since starting its campaign in mid-January - only China and the United States have administered more - but it has given the required two doses to less than 5% of its 950 million adults.Rural India is home to more than two-thirds of the country's 1.35 billion people. While urban areas account for a disproportionately large share of the confirmed COVID-19 cases, those concerned about the spread of the virus in the countryside say statistics undercount cases in villages, where testing is less comprehensive.The health system in several regions in India collapsed in April and May as the country reported the world’s biggest jump in coronavirus infections, increasing pressure on the immunisation programme.1/2Suresh Kumar, 43, ties up the hair of his wife Pramila Devi, 36, who is suffering from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), before taking her to a local government dispensary, at their home in Kaljikhal, in the northern state of Uttarakhand, India, May 23, 2021./File PhotoRead MorePrime Minister Narendra Modi's government offers vaccines to vulnerable people, healthcare workers and those aged over 45 for free. Since last month, individual states have also been expected to procure vaccines for younger adults, or to provide them commercially through the private sector.Poorer states say this leaves their residents more vulnerable. The eastern state of Jharkhand, where nearly all districts are categorised as poor, this week urged Modi to give it free vaccines for all age groups.In many states the doses for those under 45 are available mostly or entirely in urban areas. Some officials say this is intentional, as the infection spreads more easily in crowded cities.""It's because of high-positivity"" in urban areas, said Bijay Kumar Mohapatra, health director of the eastern state of Odisha, explaining the state's decision to prioritise cities.Major international and domestic firms such as Microsoft (MSFT.O), Pepsi (PEP.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Reliance Industries (RELI.NS), Adani Group and Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) have organised inoculations for their employees, in many cases in partnership with private hospitals. Most of these companies and the huge private hospitals that serve them are located in urban centres.Vaccination rates in rural areas have also been depressed because of patchier internet access to use the complex online system for signing up for shots, and possibly because of greater hesitancy among villagers than among city dwellers.""LUCRATIVE DEALS""India's Supreme Court criticised the government's handling of the vaccination programme this week and ordered it to provide a breakdown of shots given in rural and urban areas.""Private hospitals are not equally spread out"" across the country and ""are often limited to bigger cities with large populations"", the top court said in its order dated May 31.""As such, a larger quantity will be available in such cities, as opposed to the rural areas,"" it said. Private hospitals may prefer to sell doses ""for lucrative deals directly to private corporations who wish to vaccinate their employees"".Dr. Rajib Dasgupta, head of the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said the risk of inequity was that parts of India would build up immunity disproportionately.“It can leave the rural population relatively more vulnerable.”Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Meghan and Harry name baby daughter after Queen Elizabeth and Diana Meghan, Britain’s Duchess of Sussex, has given birth to her second child, a girl, whom she and husband Prince Harry have named after Queen Elizabeth and his late mother Princess Diana.Lilibet 'Lili' Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born on Friday at the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in California, with Harry in attendance. The couple's first child, Archie, was born in 2019.The choice of name pays tribute to the queen after a difficult year for the couple, and the wider royal family. Lilibet is a family nickname for the 95-year-old British monarch.Buckingham Palace said the queen, Harry’s father Prince Charles and his brother and wife, Prince William and Kate, were delighted with the news. Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined them in sending his congratulations.William and Kate said via their official Twitter account: ""We are all delighted by the happy news of the arrival of baby Lili. Congratulations to Harry, Meghan and Archie.""Meghan and Harry announced the birth with a statement.""On June 4th, we were blessed with the arrival of our daughter, Lili. She is more than we could have ever imagined, and we remain grateful for the love and prayers we've felt from across the globe,"" they said.""Thank you for your continued kindness and support during this very special time for our family.""Harry and Meghan said Lilibet's middle name was chosen to honour her grandmother, Princess Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997.Both mother and baby - who is eighth in line to the throne - were doing well and were back at home, their press secretary said.The nature of the announcement, almost two days after the birth, reflects the new life the couple have chosen in the United States.When William's wife Kate gave birth to her three children in recent years, she emerged each time alongside her husband from a London hospital just a few hours later to be photographed by the world's media that had camped out in the street.1/6Britain's Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, attend a roundtable discussion on gender equality at Windsor Castle, Windsor, Britain October 25, 2019. Jeremy Selwyn/Pool via ReutersRead MoreCRISISThe birth of Lilibet comes almost a year and a half after Harry and Meghan announced that they intended to step down from their royal roles, plunging the family into crisis.The situation deteriorated sharply in March this year when they gave an explosive interview to U.S. chat show host Oprah Winfrey, accusing one unnamed royal of making a racist remark and saying Meghan's pleas for help when she felt suicidal were ignored.The 39-year-old, whose mother is Black and father is white, said she had been naive before marrying into royalty.Harry, 36, and Meghan live in a secluded $14 million mansion in the celebrity enclave of Montecito, about 80 miles (130 km) north of Los Angeles, which is also home to Winfrey, comedian Ellen DeGeneres, and other celebrities.Harry's last major public appearance was at a VAX Live concert in Los Angeles on May 2. Meghan appeared by video at the concert, which aimed to boost vaccinations worldwide against the coronavirus.Meghan disclosed in a November 2020 essay that she suffered a miscarriage in July 2020.After the interview with Winfrey, Harry made further public criticism of his childhood, creating another public relations problem for the royal family which is led by the queen and 72-year-old Prince Charles.Just last month Harry spoke of the trauma of the loss of his mother and how that was compounded when he had to walk as a 12-year-old behind her coffin in a funeral cortege under the glare of the world's media.The queen, who lost her husband Prince Philip in April after 73 years of marriage, has said she was saddened to learn of the experiences of Harry and Meghan.The couple said they would be taking parental leave from their charity Archewell and have asked people who want to send gifts to support or learn about charities doing work for women and girls, the Archewell website said.The names given to the baby also echo those given to the only daughter of Prince William, Harry’s elder brother, who is called Charlotte Elizabeth Diana.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Taxi for hire! Bangkok cabbie hopes to capitalise on his COVID-19 shot After losing countless fares during the pandemic, Thai taxi driver Sombat Subin has sought to reassure nervous clients by letting them know in three languages on the sign above his cab that he has been vaccinated against COVID-19.""I think the lit-up sign creates confidence for passengers and I feel that it has also helped increase my income,"" said Sombat, from Nonthaburi, a province north of Bangkok.The 43-year-old said the sign, which reads ""Vaccine"" and then ""COVID"" with a tick next to it and appears in Thai, English and Mandarin, was a conversation piece in his taxi.""It's to confirm to them that the driver has been fully vaccinated... So, the passengers are not afraid,"" he said.Sombat said he became a taxi driver three years ago after finding working in an office stifling. Before the pandemic, he earned about 60,000 baht ($1,920) a month, but this has slumped to as little as 10,000 baht during the latest wave of infections.Thailand had managed to largely contain virus cases for much of last year, but since April has struggled to quell its most serious outbreak so far that includes more contagious variants.This has increased pressure on authorities to speed up vaccinations with the country's rollout lagging many neighbours.Only 2.7 million Thais have received a first vaccine dose and the government has been scrambling to source more.Authorities have tried to prioritize frontline workers including taxi drivers and public transport staff.Kanokwan Sattawong, a passenger in Sombat's taxi, said: ""I feel more confident when drivers are fully vaccinated and feel safe to use public transportation.""Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Pakistani train smashes into derailed carriages; 36 killed A train in Pakistan smashed into derailed carriages of another train on Monday, killing at least 36 people, government officials said, in the latest accident to highlight the perilous state of a more-than-165 year old railway system.The death toll was likely to rise as rescuers struggled to reach people trapped in several mangled compartments strewn across the tracks in the southern province of Sindh.A Pakistan Railways spokesman said at least 33 bodies had been taken to hospitals, among them two railway officials.

"Mexican president vows focus on poor after mixed election results Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday vowed to double down on helping the poor after a mid-term election that clipped his wings in Congress with a reduced majority but handed a clutch of new state governments to his candidates.A preliminary estimate by the National Electoral Institute (INE) after Sunday's elections put Lopez Obrador's ruling coalition on course to win between 265 and 292 of the 500 lower-house seats, short of the two-thirds majority he managed to muster in the first half of his term.Since taking office in 2018, Lopez Obrador has redirected the federal budget to welfare programs and building infrastructure including a refinery and a train.Asked how he would respond to the outcome of the elections he said he was committed to doing more for the poor.""For me it's a source of pride that the humblest and poorest are the ones who most support the program of transformation,"" he said.Lopez Obrador thanked voters for ensuring his political project would still have a majority in the lower house, and with it, the control of the budget.However, the lower-house losses are likely to curb his scope to pursue constitutional changes to bolster his drive to tighten state control of the energy sector.The outcome was roughly in line with final opinion polls, which showed the race tightening after a fatal metro accident in Mexico City and accusations that Lopez Obrador had intervened excessively in the campaign.Investors saw the election as positive for Mexico's risk outlook. The peso gained as much as 1.1% to 19.7382 to the dollar to a three-week high. Lopez Obrador has attacked his predecessors as corrupt and in hock to corporate interests who fomented poverty, inequality and violence. But he has struggled to deliver on pledges to combat gang violence and lift anemic growth.Capitalizing on discontent over his record, the opposition made gains in Mexico City, provisional results showed.The capital has been a bastion for Lopez Obrador since he rose to national prominence as mayor from 2000 to 2005. The early results suggested MORENA had lost control of a number of the capital's 16 boroughs, which it previously dominated.""We need a government that's more open to what business is proposing,"" said Enrique Prendas, 56, a Mexico City resident who voted for Lopez Obrador in 2018 but this time switched his vote to the center-right National Action Party (PAN).However Lopez Obrador and allies may be on track to win 11 of 15 state government races, enlarging the party's footprint across the country.Lopez Obrador's leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) went into the vote with 253 seats in the lower house. According to INE projections, it will win between 190 and 203.The new lower house will be seated in September.MORENA and its allies won 42.5% of votes cast for the lower house, according to a preliminary count of 89% of ballots. The main opposition alliance was slightly behind on 40.0%.MORENA's individual tally was far ahead of its nearest rival, giving it a clear advantage in picking up seats from the 300 awarded under a first-past-the-post system. The remaining 200 house seats are divvied up via proportional representation.To defend its majority, MORENA will rely on votes from the Labor Party (PT) and the Green Party, a political grouping that has proven adept at forging alliances with whoever is in power.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"ASEAN ministers pressure Myanmar after 'painfully slow' progress Southeast Asian foreign ministers mediating on the crisis in Myanmar called on Monday for its military rulers to free prisoners and start an agreed political dialogue, expressing disappointment at ""very slow"" progress so far.The United Nations, Western countries and China back the effort by the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to find a way out of the crisis in Myanmar, a country paralysed by turmoil since a Feb. 1 coup that ended a decade of tentative democracy.Vivian Balakrishnan, foreign minister of Singapore, a key investor in Myanmar, said the ASEAN diplomatic effort ""only makes sense if there is a genuine desire within Myanmar itself for genuine dialogue and negotiations and reconciliation.""To be honest with you, we are disappointed at the slow – very, very slow progress,"" he told Singapore media in a call from Chongqing, China, where ASEAN foreign ministers met their Chinese counterpart on Monday.Myanmar's junta has shown little sign of heeding a consensus reached in April among the 10 ASEAN countries, including Myanmar, which calls for an end to violence, political talks and the naming of a regional special envoy.""Indonesia is really hoping that the implementation of the five points of consensus needs to be pushed after this meeting with, once again, a transparent process,"" Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi told a news conference.Malaysian Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said ASEAN must admit that progress on the consensus was ""painfully slow"".""The int'l (international) community is awaiting ASEAN's further action,"" he said on Twitter.In a summary of remarks read at the meeting, he said ASEAN ""must act more quickly to reduce tensions and stop violence"".The junta has struggled to impose control since ousting elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, which triggered a wave of anger, protests and strikes, and efforts to build a nationwide alliance to thwart the military's bid to consolidate power.TRIAL LOOMSNobel laureate Suu Kyi, 75, will go on trial next week in the first of several criminal cases against her, according to her lawyer, who met her on Monday for a court hearing.The charges include illegal possession of two-way radios, breaking coronavirus protocols, and bribery.The trial must be concluded by July 26, chief lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told Reuters, citing the presiding judge. Suu Kyi has been held at an undisclosed location.  read more She is charged separately with violating the Official Secrets Act, punishable by 14 years in jail.The ASEAN ministers' comments follow a visit to Myanmar on Friday by two ASEAN envoys during which they urged the junta to free all detainees and discussed implementing the consensus.The envoys met military chief Min Aung Hlaing and several junta-appointed ministers, in a visit ASEAN did not announce.Unlike his more reclusive predecessors, Min Aung Hlaing has sought to maintain a high public profile since the coup.

"Peru's Castillo says there is 'hope' as razor-thin margin keeps country on edge Socialist presidential candidate Pedro Castillo said Peruvians are a ""people of hope"" on Sunday, with the country on edge as unofficial vote counts showed him and his conservative election rival separated by the thinnest of margins.A quick count of votes cast in Sunday's election, with a 1% error margin by Ipsos Peru, put Castillo, an elementary school teacher and novice politician, ahead by 0.4 of a percentage point.A previous Ipsos exit poll, with a 3% error margin, put his rival in the run-off election, Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of jailed ex-President Alberto Fujimori, up by 0.6 of a percentage point.By 1 a.m. (0600 GMT), the ONPE electoral agency had published partial official results with 61% of votes counted that put Fujimori first with 52.4% of votes and Castillo second with 47.5%. Authorities however cautioned that this count was predominantly urban, where the conservative candidate has an advantage.""We need to have faith in the people,"" Castillo said. ""Our votes still remain to be counted, the votes of the provinces.""The quick-count results triggered celebrations and cries of ""we won"" from Castillo's supporters in Tacabamba, the Andean town closest to the impoverished village where he was born and raised, which is also where he is waiting for the results.Hundreds gathered in Tacabamba's main square before midnight for a concert with a pro-Castillo presenter telling the crowd: ""yes we can"". The concert appeared to violate an 11 p.m. curfew linked to the coronavirus, which has hit Peru particularly hard.A tight race could lead to days of uncertainty as counts trickle in, and could trigger unrest if disillusioned supporters of either candidate question the results.Castillo had earlier called his supporters onto the streets after an exit poll gave a slender lead to Fujimori. But he has not made any official comment since the quick count put him as the likely winner, and neither has Fujimori.""I ask our people to defend every vote,"" Castillo wrote on Twitter when the early forecast suggested he would lose. ""I call on Peruvian people from all corners of the country to go to the streets in peace to be vigilant in the defence of democracy.""Speaking before the quick count via megaphone from a balcony to crowds in Tacabamba, Castillo appealed for calm.""We must be prudent, the people are wise,"" said the 51-year-old schoolteacher who has vowed to redistribute wealth and rewrite the constitution. ""What we have heard is not official.""Fujimori said she was reserving judgement until the official results. She also appealed for ""prudence, calm and peace from both groups, those who voted and did not vote for us.""CROWDS GATHERReuters witnesses reported a small crowd of people gathering outside the headquarters of Castillo's Peru Libre party in the capital, Lima.Opinion polls up to election day had indicated a statistical dead heat, with Fujimori, who had earlier trailed Castillo, pulling slightly ahead at the end of campaigning.  read more Polls showed urban and higher-income citizens prefer Fujimori, while the rural poor largely support Castillo.Both candidates have pledged vastly different remedies for rescuing Peru from the economic doldrums brought on by the COVID-19 crisis, which has seen it lead the world in per capital deaths.Fujimori, a 46-year-old who has tilted at the presidency twice before, has pledged to follow the free-market model and maintain economic stability in the world’s second-largest copper producer.Castillo, the son of peasant farmers, has promised to redraft the constitution to strengthen the role of the state, take a larger portion of profits from mining firms and nationalize key industries.Voting in the Lima district of Surco on Sunday afternoon, Fujimori noted a handful of allegations of doctored voting papers discovered in the capital and the country´s interior.""We know that there have been incidents today. We hope that the electoral bodies will take action on the matter and sanctions will be issued accordingly,"" she said. ""I also expect our party officials to be on their guard.""In Lima, voters made their way to polling stations by bike, roller skates and on foot to traffic jams that built up as the day progressed.Among those casting their vote in Lima was Luis Pizango, who said that for him, ""transparency"" was key.""May Peru win for the good of all Peruvians,"" he said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Hungary appears to back-pedal on Chinese university plans after protests Hungary appeared to backtrack on plans to build a Chinese university in the capital Budapest after thousands took to the streets at the weekend accusing the government of cosying up to Beijing, provoking an angry Chinese response.Opponents of nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban fear the planned $2 billion campus could undercut the quality of higher education and help Beijing increase its influence in Hungary and the European Union.  read more A senior Orban aide said late on Sunday the university was not even at the planning phase, and once the plan took shape, in early 2023, it could be put to a referendum.""Once the project's conditions are known, we support a referendum in Budapest to decide whether locals want Fudan University here,"" Gergely Gulyas, Orban's chief of staff, told the pro-government news web site Mandiner late on Sunday.Orban, a self-styled illiberal, has built cordial ties with China, including massive joint business projects, and has several times this year blocked EU statements denouncing China's record on human rights, angering his allies.  read more According to media reports, the government was willing to pay for the construction of Shanghai-based Fudan University's first campus in Europe with a Chinese loan. The campus would displace a planned local student housing area.Public support for the campus is low, according to an opinion survey conducted last month, and Orban's ruling Fidesz party has weak support in Budapest, so a referendum could turn out against the project.Orban and Fidesz face their first competitive elections next year after three successive landslides since 2010. Opposition parties have united against Fidesz for the first time and caught up with them in polls.Political observers say Orban could decide to bide his time on Fudan and return to the idea after the election.""It is hallmark Fidesz to take two steps back to wait until the issue loses political steam, then attempt it again when it is more convenient politically,"" Political Capital analyst Peter Kreko said.Orban has abandoned unpopular projects before, such as a tax on internet traffic, a separate administrative court system and  plans to privatise marinas at Lake Balaton.OPPOSITION SPARS WITH CHINAGergely Karacsony, the opposition mayor of Budapest and a top contender to challenge Orban in elections next year, said on Saturday the university protest was a symbol of Hungarians rejecting heavy-handed government decisions.""Although we are worlds apart on human rights... we really just don't want a Chinese elite school built at the expense of Hungarian taxpayers,"" Karacsony told Saturday's rally.A media spokesman at the Chinese Embassy in Hungary, who did not give his name, criticised Karacsony's comments on the embassy's Facebook page.""In broad daylight, it is unseemly to criticize the internal affairs of another country, especially when I heard some key words in his speech, such as 'Tiananmen Square protests', 'democracy', 'human rights' and 'values',"" the official said.The Chinese embassy said it would address Reuters questions on a planned Fudan referendum at a later stage.Hungary blocked an EU statement in April criticising China's new security law in Hong Kong, undermining the bloc's efforts to confront Beijing's curbing of freedoms in the former British colony.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1

"Carbon dioxide in the air at highest level since measurements began Despite a massive reduction in commuting and in many commercial activities during the early months of the pandemic, the amount of carbon in Earth's atmosphere in May reached its highest level in modern history, a global indicator released on Monday showed.Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, said the findings, based on the amount of carbon dioxide in the air at NOAA's weather station on Mauna Loa in Hawaii, was the highest since measurements began 63 years ago.The measurement, called the Keeling Curve after Charles David Keeling, the scientist who began tracking carbon dioxide there in 1958, is a global benchmark for atmospheric carbon levels.Instruments perched on NOAA's mountaintop observatory recorded carbon dioxide at about 419 parts per million last month, more than the 417 parts per million in May 2020.Because carbon dioxide is a key driver of climate change, the findings show that reducing the use of fossil fuels, deforestation and other practices that lead to carbon emissions must be a top priority to avoid catastrophic consequences, Pieter Tans, a scientist with NOAA's Global Monitoring Laboratory, said in a report on the emissions.“We are adding roughly 40 billion metric tons of CO2 pollution to the atmosphere per year,” Tans wrote. “That is a mountain of carbon that we dig up out of the Earth, burn, and release into the atmosphere as CO2 - year after year.""The amount of carbon in the air now is as much as it was about 4 million years ago, a time when sea level was 78 feet (24 meters) higher than it is today and the average temperature was 7 degrees Fahrenheit higher than it was before the Industrial Revolution, the report said.Despite the pandemic lockdown, scientists were not able to see a drop in the overall amount of carbon in the atmosphere  partly because of wildfires, which also release carbon, as well as the natural behavior of carbon in the atmosphere, the report said.The carbon dioxide levels measured were not affected by the eruption of Hawaiian volcanoes, Tans said, adding the station is situated far enough from active volcanoes that measurements are not distorted, and occasional plumes of carbon dioxide are removed from the data.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Kremlin critic Dmitry Gudkov says his Russia exit is a tactical retreat Russian opposition politician Dmitry Gudkov said on Monday his decision to leave Russia was a temporary and tactical retreat because he could no longer practice politics effectively due to unprecedented pressure from the authorities.Gudkov, who was held in custody for two days last week in a case he said was fabricated, said on Sunday he had left Russia  after receiving warnings from people close to the Kremlin that he would be arrested if he remained in the country. Gudkov, who sat in Russia's lower house of parliament until 2016, had hoped to run for a seat again in September but said the pressure on him and his family from the authorities had made it impossible to pursue politics inside Russia for now.""I want to return to Russia. This is some sort of a temporary retreat, to gather up strength and move on... into the battle,"" he told Reuters in an interview after his arrival in Kyiv.""If I did not leave, they would have started repression against me and my whole family.

"EU veto ‘hostage’-taking on foreign policy must end -Germany’s Maas Germany’s foreign minister said on Monday the European Union should abolish the right of individual member states to veto foreign policy measures as the 27-nation bloc could not allow itself to be “held hostage”.His comments, which came days after a more junior official criticised Hungary by name, reflect growing frustration in Berlin at the way in which EU member countries can prevent it from acting in matters on which almost all members agree.""We can't let ourselves be held hostage by the people who hobble European foreign policy with their vetoes,"" Heiko Maas told a conference of Germany's ambassadors in Berlin.""If you do that then sooner or later you are risking the cohesion of Europe.

In recent years this common foreign policy approach, motivated by domestic political considerations, has led to the European Union's foreign policy stance becoming a laughing stock,"" Orban said.He said the EU's foreign policy should be decided by heads of states and governments instead of what he called bureacrats, citing the latest meeting of the European Council regarding Russia as a positive example.""As far as Europe's policy on China is concerned, we believe that we must prevent the reemergence of Cold War policies and culture in world politics,"" the nationalist premier added.Last month, Budapest refused to ratify a new EU trade and development accord with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and also declined to support an EU call for a ceasefire in violence between Israel and the Palestinians.Under Orban, Hungary has pursued closer ties with China, most recently agreeing to host a foreign campus of a Chinese university in Budapest over a chorus of opposition protest.

"Once a lock for ruling party, opposition make electoral gains in Mexican capital Mexico's sprawling capital has long been a bedrock of support for President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, dating back to his term as mayor years ago, but city voters shifted on Sunday, giving opponents a string of major wins, according to preliminary results.The congressional election in the country looked likely to give Lopez Obrador's allies a majority, albeit slimmed down. In Mexico City, though, his party did not fare so well in elections for borough leaders.While his leftist National Regeneration Movement, known as MORENA, held on to Mexico City's most populous boroughs, including Iztapalapa and Gustavo Madero, it lost nine of the capital's 16 districts.Lopez Obrador blamed the opposition gains on unfriendly press coverage.""You have to keep in mind that this is where there were more attacks from the media,"" said Lopez Obrador, speaking at his regular morning news conference at the national palace in downtown Mexico City.The leftist leader often lashes out at the media, which he derides as mostly elitist and overly concentrated in the capital.More outreach was needed, he said on Monday.Lopez Obrador built up his power base in the capital when he served as mayor from 2000 to 2005, and MORENA took all but four of the boroughs when Lopez Obrador swept to power three years ago in a landslide election victory.But the opposition was able to capitalize on discontent over his record since he became president.

In another, a police inspector who refused to hand over weapons was shot to death.The head of the national police, Leon Charles, confirmed two of the attacks and the inspector's death, telling a news conference on Sunday that authorities were intensifying efforts to combat the gangs.He said police had restored control of a highway leading south from the capital that had been blocked by gang warfare around the troubled neighborhood of Martissant since last Wednesday.The latest flare-up appeared to have killed about 10 people - including civilians - and forced thousands to flee the area as assailants torched homes and businesses, the office of civil protection said in a statement.Videos on social media last week showed bodies along the empty highway that was manned by gunmen.

"Women score historic wins in Mexico’s mid-term elections Women were poised to win a record number of state governors’ offices in Mexican mid-term elections on Sunday, capturing territory long dominated by men and giving them a bigger political platform to reach the presidency one day.Preliminary tallies by electoral authorities on Monday showed female candidates securing six of the 15 regional bastions on offer, just two shy of the total number of women ever elected to lead regional governments in Mexico's history.Five of the six went to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), which dominated the state votes, even as the leftist party’s hold on the lower house of Congress weakened. If results are confirmed, it means the northern border states of Baja California and Chihuahua, Guerrero and Colima on the Pacific coast, as well as Tlaxcala in the center and Campeche in the south, will be governed by women.""This is a cultural shift,"" said MORENA lawmaker Gabriela Cuevas, the first Mexican to head the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a global body of national parliaments. ""And definitely a step forward for women in our country and in political life.""Only eight women had previously won regional elections, including the current mayor of Mexico City, MORENA's Claudia Sheinbaum, who is regarded as one of the favorites to succeed Lopez Obrador as president.Since Griselda Alvarez was chosen to run Colima in 1979 - a few weeks after Margaret Thatcher made history as Britain's first woman Prime Minister - Mexico's handful of female governors very rarely overlapped with other women in the job.Now seven out of the 32 regional governments, including Mexico City, will be run by women simultaneously.That is likely to create space for a different kind of politics where women's concerns gain in prominence, said Francisco Abundis, head of Mexican polling firm Parametria.That was especially true as three of the new governors are under 40 and may have long careers ahead of them, he noted.VOTER STRENGTHThe latest national census showed there are roughly 3 million more women than men among Mexico's population of 126 million, and political leaders are increasingly at pains to ensure equal representation in government.Lopez Obrador made history in 2018 by appointing a cabinet split evenly between men and women, though he has come under fire from women's groups for failing to take seriously enough issues like domestic violence and abortion rights.Many women were angry about Lopez Obrador's support for MORENA's original candidate for Guerrero, Felix Salgado, whose campaign was dogged by rape accusations.Salgado denied the allegations but was eventually forced out of the race by electoral authorities for campaign finance irregularities. He was replaced by his daughter Evelyn, who won Guerrero on Sunday night, the results showed.Some Mexicans argue that male domination is still too deeply entrenched in the country for a female president to be realistic as soon as 2024, when the next election is due.""Because of the macho mentality,"" argued Gypsy Lara, a 29-year-old business owner in Mexico City who said she would be happy to back Sheinbaum for president.Sheinbaum, whose popularity took a hit last month over a metro accident that killed 26 people, had a tough night on Sunday with MORENA suffering shock losses in city elections.Despite the setbacks, the 58-year-old is still one of the strongest candidates for the presidency, said Abundis.""I think (female candidates) will be one of the cards to play in 2024,"" he said. ""With everything we're seeing in terms of gender-based movements in the country and the world, in Mexico it's more of a contrast with the whole macho tradition.""Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1

"How China's vaccine diplomacy brought bosom buddy Cambodia even closer Almost one in every five Cambodians has already received a dose of anti-coronavirus vaccine, catapulting the country well past wealthier, bigger Southeast Asian neighbours. Like the doses, the success story is labelled 'Made in China'.Already one of China's closest allies, Cambodia kickstarted inoculations with a bigger donation of vaccines from China than any other country in the region - in addition to Chinese vaccines it had already bought itself.Cambodia's early progress reflects Beijing's vaccine diplomacy in a region where competition with U.S. influence is intense, but has increased concerns among some Cambodians over the closeness of those ties. The United States announced its first major donations to Asia last week.""The question is asked whether Cambodia is too dependent on China,"" authoritarian Prime Minister Hun Sen said in a recent speech. ""If I don't rely on China, whom should I rely on? Without the donations and sales of vaccines from China, we would not have vaccinated the Cambodian people.""Only the wealthy city state of Singapore has made more rapid progress in Southeast Asia relative to population.Some 16% of Cambodia's 16 million people have had at least one vaccine dose, according to official numbers. Close behind are tiny Brunei and then Laos, another state with very close links to Beijing.Much bigger Malaysia and Indonesia had only managed 7.6% and 6.6% respectively, with Thailand on 4.6% and the Philippines 4.2%, according to the latest official data.In Vietnam, where anti-China feeling runs strong, little more than 1% of the population had been covered.

"Mongolia votes for new president amid COVID-19 campaign curbs Mongolia goes to the polls on Wednesday to choose its sixth democratically-elected president, with the ruling Mongolian People’s Party (MPP) on the cusp of consolidating its power following a low-key campaign crimped by COVID-19 curbs.The vote is the first after constitutional amendments stripped the office of some of its powers and limited holders to a single six-year term, so keeping incumbent Khaltmaa Battulga of the opposition Democratic Party from seeking re-election.Ukhnaa Khurelsukh, forced to resign as prime minister after protests this year, is the favourite to take over the presidency for the MPP, which already controls parliament and government.The Democratic Party is fielding Sodnomzundui Erdene to replace Battulga.Campaign events in the capital, Ulaanbaatar, have been kept to a minimum as it battles COVID-19. Daily infections hit a record over the last week and Mongolia's deaths stand at 325.""Because of coronavirus there is very little election campaign information, and I will probably decide at the time,"" said a 22-year-old voter, Ganbayar Gantulga.About 1,000 of Khurelsukh's supporters held a rally outside a concert hall on Saturday, but he moved his campaign online a few hours later after his Labor Party rival Dangaasuren Enkhbat, the third election candidate, tested positive for coronavirus.Mongolia's hybrid political system gives parliament the power to make laws and appoint governments, but it also gives the president a veto over legislation.Voters usually chose opposition party candidates as president. Although winners must relinquish party allegiance, they have tended to block legislation on party lines, creating political deadlock that some say has held back the country.Although businessman and former wrestler Battulgahe failed to overturn the decision to exclude him from this year's elections, he remains popular among some voters.""Battulga has done quite a lot for the people,"" said Tsetsegmaa Khasbat, a 67-year-old retiree.

"In crackdown on fraud from Myanmar, China authorities target suspects' families Chinese authorities are trying to lure back fugitive fraudsters operating across the border in Myanmar by threatening to cut off pensions and other benefits for family members, according to social media postings by public security bodies.Since a Feb. 1 coup in Myanmar, economic collapse and lawlessness have created conditions for an upsurge in criminal activity, particularly in northern border areas and by Chinese gangs, according to a report from the United States Institute of Peace.Large-scale criminal groups have long operated in the region, much of it outside the control of the military junta, using it as a base for well-organised telecoms and internet fraud scams, as well as hosting illegal casinos.The actions by local authorities come after China's President Xi Jinping said in April that China will resolutely crack down on telecoms and internet fraud.According to notices from Chinese public security departments in at least five counties early this month, suspects in Myanmar face losing their household registration permit - a key document linked to residence and access to public services - if they don't turn themselves in, and would be unable to return to China.One county in Jiangxi province said it would seek to suspend pensions and medical coverage for the immediate relatives of 33 suspects, giving the names and addresses of the suspects. The notice was later deleted from WeChat.A county in Hunan province said social welfare guarantees for family members of suspects would be cancelled, while houses built using illicit funds would be destroyed and the people residing there would be expelled.The official People's Daily WeChat account reposted one of the notices.The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Public Security did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Much of northern Myanmar, where most of the notices said suspects were located, is under the control of militias, some of which are opposed to the military that seized power in a coup in February, while others support it or have remained neutral.""In the two months since the military reestablished its tumultuous rule, criminal activities in Myanmar have widened dramatically, posing new challenges to the region's efforts and ability to control cross-border crime,"" the United States Institute of Peace, a U.S.-government funded nonpartisan institute, said in its April report.Large tracts of northern Myanmar are also part of the Golden Triangle illicit drug producing region, while areas in the north and north-east that border China and Thailand have a proliferation of illegal casinos that law enforcement authorities say are used for money laundering.A television show released in China this year dramatised efforts by the country's police to fight transnational crimes- including telecoms fraud, committed by or against Chinese nationals abroad. One Southeast Asian region called ""Country M"" featured in the drama.In one 2019 telecoms fraud case involving 10 million yuan  ($1.56 million), Chinese police cooperated with their counterparts in northern Myanmar to bring back 69 Chinese nationals, according to the state-backed China Daily.Security experts fear that the collapsing economy and increased fighting between ethnic militias and the Myanmar military in the wake of the coup will see a surge in illicit activity to finance armed groups.

"Watch Live: New Fauci Emails Contain Damning Details – MSM In Full Damage Control You have found the Friday edition of The American Journal, hosted by Harrison Smith.",0,1
"Scientist At Center Of Lab Leak Controversy Put In Charge Of The Lancet’s Task Force To Investigate Virus Origin Revered scientific journal The Lancet has created a ‘task force’ to investigate the origins of the coronavirus that caused a global pandemic, yet it has decided to employ as its leader the very guy who funded the dangerous gain of function research at the Wuhan lab and subsequently allegedly ‘bullied’ other scientists into avoiding looking into the lab as a potential source of the outbreak. In the wake of renewed scrutiny of the lab leak hypothesis, the Lancet’s task force will reportedly “focus on analyzing data on all of the theories put forward on the origins of COVID, on the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 was able to break out of Wuhan and spread globally, and on the most plausible strategies to prevent future pandemics.” It also states that “The Task Force will review thoroughly and objectively all publicly available evidence, particularly the peer-reviewed literature, and conduct interviews with key leaders in science, medicine, policy and civil society.” ‘Objectively’. Right. Dr Peter Daszak, who is heading up this task force, is perhaps the least suitable scientist on the planet to objectively analyse the data, given his track record. Daszak, as President of the EcoHealth Alliance, shovelled at least $600,000 to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the past few years to play around with coronaviruses inside the lab through the now infamous ‘gain of function’ research. Daszak, who also works for the World Health Organisation, is on record admitting that he was involved with manipulating coronaviruses. Here is a video of him talking in DECEMBER 2019 about how ‘good’ the viruses are for altering in a lab: Daszak notes that “coronaviruses are pretty good… you can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily… the spiked proteins drive a lot about what happens. You can get the sequence you can build the protein, we work with Ralph Baric at UNC to do this, insert into the backbone of another virus and do some work in a lab.” No wonder then that Daszak as lead investigator for the WHO investigation determined within 3 hours of visiting the Wuhan lab in February 2021 that there was ‘nothing to see here’? Recently released emails now document that Daszak thanked Dr Fauci for dismissing the lab leak theory before any scientific research had been done on the possibility. Daszak was later employed as an ‘expert fact checker’ by Facebook when it was monitoring and removing ‘misinformation’ about the origins of COVID on its platform, much of which was credible scientific research. Facebook has since reversed the policy of banning any posts containing information suggesting COVID-19 was “man-made”. Daszak’s Twitter profile is basically one long ‘it came from bats not a lab’ thread, much to the annoyance of some other scientists: Having approved the awarding of NIH funding to Wuhan Institute of Virology–twice–Fauci has a massive conflict of interest on subject.Failure to disclose this conflict of interest represents journalistic malpractice.— Richard H. Ebright (@R_H_Ebright) May 5, 2020 Why does this guy keep getting put in charge of investigations, task forces and ‘fact checking’, when it’s abundantly clear that he has the biggest motive to dismiss the lab leak notion? As microbiologist Professor Richard Ebright has noted, “Daszak was the contractor who funded the laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology that potentially was the source of the virus with subcontracts from $200million [£142million] from the US Department of State and $7million [£5million] from the US National Institutes of Health and he was a collaborator and co-author on research projects at the laboratory.” Daszak has already lied about the type of research that was being conducted at the Wuhan lab, claiming, after the outbreak happened, that he didn’t know if it was gain of function or not. His own previous statements, and the Fauci emails prove he knew full well what was going on in the lab. In addition, as reported by The Daily Mail and other outlets, Daszak “orchestrated a ‘bullying’ campaign and coerced top scientists into signing off on a letter to The Lancet aimed at removing blame for Covid-19 from the Wuhan lab he was funding with US money.” Daszak used his influence to get the journal to publish the letter, which stated that to even suggest the lab leak theory had any credibility was equal to spreading “fear, rumours, and prejudice.” It effetely shut down discussion among the scientific ‘consensus’ of the lab leak potential for a whole year until intelligence findings brought the matter back to the attention of the mainstream media. WHO scientific advisor Jamie Metzl described Daszak’s letter as “scientific propaganda and a form of thuggery and intimidation.” “By labelling anyone with different views a conspiracy theorist, the Lancet letter was the worst form of bullying in full contravention of the scientific method,” Metzl added. The letter further stated that “We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin,” and even had the audacity to state that “We declare no competing interests.” Indeed, Daszak had made sure that the letter would be devoid of any link to EcoHealth, and even considered leaving his own name off it, emails released via the Freedom of Information Act have revealed. To make matters worse, the other members of The Lancet’s task force are practically all minions of Daszak, some of whom helped him draft the letter that unequivocally stated the lab leak theory was dangerous, and others who either worked with him on ‘fact checking’ for Facebook, or were cited as sources during that activity. Taking all this into account, it is obvious what the outcome of The Lancet’s inquiry will be, and it should not and cannot be used as credible evidence against the lab leak theory. ——————————————————————————————————————— ALERT!

"German Study Finds Lockdown ‘Had No Effect’ on Stopping Spread of Coronavirus A major new study by German scientists at Munich University has found that lockdowns had no effect on reducing the country’s coronavirus infection rate. Oh. “Statisticians at Munich University found “no direct connection” between the German lockdown and falling infection rates in the country,” reports the Telegraph. The study found that, on all three occasions before Germany imposed its lockdowns in November, December and April, infection rates had already begun to fall. The R rate – the number that indicates how many other people an infected person passes the virus to – was already under 1 before the lockdown restrictions came into force. As we highlighted last year, a leaked study from inside the German Ministry of the Interior revealed that the impact of the country’s lockdown could end up killing more people than the coronavirus due to victims of other serious illnesses not receiving treatment. This is by no means the only study to have concluded that lockdowns are completely useless and don’t work. A peer reviewed study published in January by Stanford researchers found that mandatory lockdowns do not provide more benefits to stopping the spread of COVID-19 than voluntary measures such as social distancing. Back in March, Stanford medical professor Dr. Jay Bhattacharya told Newsweek that COVID-19 lockdowns are “the single worst public health mistake in the last 100 years.” Earlier this year, academics from Duke, Harvard, and Johns Hopkins concluded that there could be around a million excess deaths over the next two decades as a result of lockdowns. Other research has concluded lockdowns will conservatively “destroy at least seven times more years of human life” than they save. ——————————————————————————————————————— ALERT!

"50-Year-Old Mother Charged With ‘Transphobic Hate Crime’ For Tweeting a Photo of a Suffragette Ribbon A 50-year-old mother in Scotland has been charged with a ‘transphobic hate crime’ and faces up to two years in prison after she retweeted an image of a suffragette ribbon. Yes, really. Unhinged transgender activists targeted Marion Millar after ludicrously claiming that the ribbon represented a noose. The Scottish feminist drew their ire after campaigning to protect biological women’s spaces and right to express themselves. “The messages investigated by officers are understood to include a retweeted photograph of a bow of ribbons in the green, white and purple colours of the Suffragettes, tied around a tree outside the Glasgow studio where a BBC soap opera is shot,” reports the Times. Millar was forced to attend a 2 hour police interview and was subsequently charged under the Malicious Communications Act. A woman faces two years in prison for tweets.

That right doesn’t exist in any declaration I have ever read.” “Police and politicians seem to have lost sight of this,” she added. Millar opposes gender self-identification because she asserts that it makes it easier for male sex predators to hide their intentions. “Gender identity is a belief. Not a fact. Sex is a fact. Not a belief.

The Senator also pointed to the email from Dr. Peter Daszak, President of the EcoHealth Alliance, a group that directly funded the Wuhan lab gain of function research, thanking Fauci for not giving credence to the lab leak theory. Ingraham asked Paul if Fauci could face felony culpability, to which the Senator replied “At the very least, there is ethical culpability,” and Fauci should be fired from his government roles.

First, let me say, I do think we need to get answers here. An investigation is very much needed.” He added that back then, there was the theory that the virus was the result of bioweapons research, which wasn’t a viable theory, adding, “And so the idea that it was, on the other hand, a lab accident, where they were studying this virus, which maybe did occur in nature, but it got loose in the lab, that theory didn’t get nearly as much attention perhaps as it should have. I will tell you, it was always on my mind. I know it was on Tony Fauci’s mind. But none of us ran to the microphone to say, we need to worry about the fact that this could have been a lab leak. It — at the present time, we have no more data or less data to support that. Suddenly, it’s emerged in a lot of people’s minds as, oh, that’s the leading explanation.” The America First perspective on Fauci’s emails.",0,1
"Russia’s $186 Billion Sovereign Wealth Fund Dumps All Dollar Assets Following a series of corporate cyberattacks that American intelligence agencies have blamed on Russian actors, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund (officially the National Wellbeing Fund) has decided to dump all of its dollars and dollar-denominated assets in favor of those denominated in euros, yuan – or simply buying precious metals like gold, which Russia’s central bank has increasingly favored for its own reserves. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov made the announcement Thursday morning at the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. “We can make this change rather quickly, within a month,” Siluanov told reporters Thursday. He explained that the Kremlin is moving to reduce exposure to US assets as President Biden threatens more economic sanctions against Russia following the latest ransomware attacks. The transfer will affect $119 billion in liquid assets, Bloomberg reported, but the sales will largely be executed through the Russian Central bank and its massive reserves, limiting the market impact and reducing visibility on what exactly the sovereign wealth fund will be buying. “The central bank can make these changes to the Wellbeing Fund without resorting to market operations,” said Sofya Donets, economist at Renaissance Capital in Moscow. “This in some sense a technical thing.”Jordan Rochester, currency strategist at Nomura International PLC, said, “This is a transfer of euros from the central bank to the wealth fund, we’ll then see the central bank the holder of the USDs and it’s up to them to manage it. No initial market impact.” How oppressed are you when every major western capitol city is blanketed with your flag? The news isn’t a complete surprise: The Bank of Russia, Russia’s central bank, has steadily reduced its dollar holdings over the last few years amid increasing sanctions pressure from the US and Europe. That trend continued through President Trump’s term. Just a few days ago, we reported that the Russian parliament had just authorized the sovereign wealth fund to buy gold through the central bank. However, the central bank reports its holdings with a six-month lag, making it impossible to determine its current holdings. Russia’s gold holdings eclipsed its dollar reserves last year despite a halt in gold purchases. This was partly due to an increase in the value of its gold holdings with the rise in gold prices, and partly a function of the central bank’s continued efforts to shed dollar assets. The wealth fund currently holds 35% of its liquid assets in dollars, worth about $41.5 billion, with the same amount in euros and the rest spread across yuan, gold, yen and pounds. After this latest change, the fund’s assets will be held 40% in euros, 30% in yuan, 20% in gold and 5% each in yen and pounds, Siluanov said. Source: Bloomberg The wealth fund holds savings from Russia’s oil revenues above a cutoff price and is used to help offset shortfalls when the market falls below that level. Together with illiquid assets, its total value is $185.9 billion. A few years ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that Washington was inadvertently accelerating de-dollarization with its aggressive financial sanctions, which were forcing its geopolitical adversaries to reduce their dependence on the greenback. Just last month, Russia reached a new milestone whereby fewer than 50% of its exports were paid for in dollars. Dedollarisation is inevitable as the US attempts to assert itself to prevent it's accelerating decline. Thus speeding up the attempts by Russia, China and others to remove themselves from the dollar. https://t.co/TeEO4K974A— Red Star Radio (@Red_Star_Radio) June 3, 2021 It appears that after years of steadily reducing its dependence on the dollar, Russia is about to intensify those efforts in a way that Washington will be forced to take notice.",0,1
"‘Neither legal nor constitutional’: Virginia teacher who was put on leave for opposing gender pronoun rules SUES school district A Virginia gym teacher has sued his school district after he was placed on administrative leave and put under investigation for speaking out against a rule requiring him to address students by their chosen gender pronouns. Lawyers for Byron ‘Tanner’ Cross, a gym teacher at Leesburg Elementary School, filed suit against the Loudoun County School Board and two of the district’s top executives on Tuesday, alleging that he suffered “content and viewpoint-based retaliation” after openly opposing the pronoun rule at a board meeting last month. According to the lawsuit, Cross was called to meet with his superiors two days after he spoke out and told he was under investigation for “conduct that has had a disruptive impact on the operations” of the school. The core issue of the case, the suit said, is whether public schools can “punish a teacher for objecting… to a proposed policy” that would force them to“express ideas about human nature” that they believe are false – especially at a board meeting, which are meant to host open dialogue about school policies. The meeting included discussion of two transgender-related policy changes – allowing students to use the gender identity and pronouns of their choice, and letting them participate in sports activities based on their gender identity, rather than their biological sex. Cross said his comments were based on his sincerely held religious and philosophical beliefs, as well as his expertise and experience as an educator. “I love all of my students, but I will never lie to them, regardless of the consequences,” Cross said at the meeting. “I’m a teacher, but I serve God first, and I will not affirm that a biological boy can be a girl and vice versa, because it’s against my religion. It’s lying to a child, it’s abuse to a child, and it’s sinning against our god.” A video of his 45-second speech was widely shared on social media and attracted major media coverage. The Alliance for Defending Freedom (ADF), a conservative activist group, is representing Cross in the lawsuit. In a letterpublished on the teacher’s behalf last week, the ADF argued that “public schools have no business compelling teachers to express ideological beliefs that they don’t hold.” “The school favors certain beliefs, and it wants to force Tanner to cry uncle and endorse them as well. That’s neither legal nor constitutional, and neither was the school’s move to place Tanner on leave,” ADF Senior Counsel Tyson Langhofer said. Loudoun County is located about 40 miles northwest of Washington, DC. The school district has been embroiled in ideological controversies previously, including public backlash over a decision in March to “downgrade” the use of Dr. Seuss books during its ‘Read Across America Day,’ citing concerns about “racial undertones” in the popular author’s stories. On Wednesday, one day after the gym teacher’s lawsuit was filed, a group of parents reportedly sued the district in federal court over initiatives that allegedly discriminate against white students based on their race. The district has also stirred controversy for teaching critical race theory (CRT), a doctrine that posits that racism is deeply ingrained in American laws and institutions. Several states are seeking to ban or limit the teaching of CRT over concerns that it is divisive and encourages students to place undue focus on race. Republican-led legislatures in Idaho, Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee and Oklahoma have already passed bills restricting CRT in school curriculums.",0,0
"Twitter Suspends Organization for Announcing They Will Release More Fauci Emails The Informed Consent Action Network was suspended by Twitter on Thursday after they announced that they will soon be publishing more emails from Anthony Fauci. ICAN, an organisation dedicated to increasing informed consent regarding vaccinations, tweeted on Thursday that following the release of thousands of pages from emails from Anthony Fauci that had been revealed through Freedom of Information Act requests from the Washington Post and Buzzfeed, that they would be “dropping 3000 new pages of FOIA’d Fauci emails” that evening, “providing further insight into Anthony Fauci’s actions on Covid, Vaccine Safety, and more.” However, conservative commentator Michelle Malkin later announced that ICAN had been suspended by Twitter for announcing they would release more emails from Fauci. In a screenshot posted by Malkin to the Big Tech site, ICAN’s Twitter had been locked, due to the tweet allegedly “violating their policy on spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19.” My friends at @ICANdecide were suspended by Twitter today for reporting that they have 3,000 additional pages of Fauci's emails they obtained thru FOIA!

On their website, Twitter declares that “in order for content related to COVID-19 to be labeled or removed under this policy, it must: advance a claim of fact, expressed in definitive terms; be demonstrably false or misleading, based on widely available, authoritative sources; and be likely to impact public safety or cause serious harm.” Twitter’s further five categories within this policy relating to discussions surrounding the coronavirus outbreak also do not seem to contain any rules which would have resulted in the tweet from ICAN being removed. (BREAKING: President Trump Blasts Fauci For Wuhan ‘Gain of Function’ Research, Devastating Emails In New Statement) National File reached out to Twitter for comment on this story, asking which area of their COVID-19 misinformation policy ICAN violated, but did not receive a response by the time of publication. National File has reported extensively on the contents of Fauci’s emails. One email chain from February of 2020 show that Fauci was not concerned with the new variant of COVID-19, and believed that it would be only as mild as the previous swine flu pandemic from 2009. In another email from the same month, Fauci said that “most transmissions” of virus “occur from someone who is symptomatic” and “not asymptomatic.” However, Fauci publicly touted the idea that asymptomatic spread is “not rare” but in fact common, as the medical experts spread fear about the virus. Yet another email exchange from Fauci shows him promising to pressure then-President Trump to intimidate Florida Governor Ron DeSantis into closing gyms, bars and beaches. Fauci and another physician raged at citizens exercising their individual liberty, with Fauci saying that he screamed during television interviews “2 to 5 times per night” when he saw young people having fun.",0,1
"Peaceful Capitol Protester Threatened With 20 Yrs In Prison For Taking Selfie And Praying On Senate Floor Takes Plea Deal Peaceful Jan 6 Capitol protester Paul Allard Hodgkins was maliciously overcharged by the feds with “obstructing an official proceeding of Congress” and faced 20 years in prison for the crime of taking a selfie on the Senate floor with others as they “cheered and said prayers.” Hodgkins only spent 15 minutes inside “the People’s House” but after being threatened with two decades in prison he accepted a plea deal on Wednesday leaving him facing some “15 to 21 months [in prison] under federal guidelines.” From The Washington Post, “Tampa man pleads guilty to felony in Jan. 6 Capitol riot; his recommended prison sentence could set bar for other cases”: Alex Jones breaks down the well documented public racism and motives to enact racist legislation of President Joe Biden. A Tampa man who carried a Trump flag into the well of the Senate on Jan. 6 pleaded guilty Wednesday to one felony count of storming the Capitol to obstruct Congress’s certification of the 2020 presidential election.Paul Allard Hodgkins, 38, did not enter a cooperation deal with prosecutors, and he is not accused of any other wrongdoing or involvement with extremist groups.In admitting to the stiffest felony count charged by prosecutors against individuals not otherwise accused of conspiracy or violence in the Capitol riot, Hodgkins faces a prison sentence of 15 to 21 months under federal guidelines. His sentencing is poised to become a test case watched by other defendants deciding whether to accept pleas, several defense lawyers said.“I have decided that I will accept this plea offer, and I will plead guilty to charge one,” Hodgkins told U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss.Hodgkins’s attorney, Patrick Leduc, said he would seek a lower sentence at a sentencing hearing as soon as July 19, and he asked the judge to waive a $7,500 to $75,000 fine because his client also agreed to pay $2,000 in restitution for his share of riot damage to the Capitol.[…] “Paul is an Eagle Scout with no prior record, a working Joe who is a crane operator at a steel processing plant,” who spent 15 minutes inside the Capitol, Leduc said.[…] Nearly half the defendants face only misdemeanor charges likely to carry no prison time for first offenders. However, about 200 are charged with obstructing an official proceeding of Congress and are accused of intending to impede or interfere with Congress’s confirmation of the electoral vote count. The charge carries a maximum 20-year prison term.The threat of heavy jail time led to the first guilty plea stemming from Jan. 6 by Jon Ryan Schaffer, described in court documents as a founding member of the Oath Keepers. Schaffer agreed on April 16 to cooperate fully with prosecutors and is among at least 19 members of the right-wing group whose members or associates have been charged with planning for violence in the Capitol attack. Schaffer, 53, a guitarist and songwriter for the heavy metal band Iced Earth, could face roughly four years in prison, although if his cooperation is valuable to prosecutors in other cases, he might be able to shave a significant amount of time off that sentence.[…] Hodgkins admitted that he “corruptly endeavored to influence, obstruct, or impede” Congress in a signed statement of offense that was read by prosecutors in court. Reading from the statement, Sedky said Hodgkins was holding the flag with other individuals while they “shout, cheer and say prayers” from the elevated platform and desk in the Senate well. Overcharging drug dealers in the hood to extract plea deals is “systemic oppression” but overcharging folks like Hodgkins for taking a selfie and praying is “defending democracy!”",0,1

"Peter Schiff: Americans Are Worried About Inflation If you’ve been to the grocery store, or the gas station, or the building supply store, you know we have an inflation problem. Last month’s hotter than expected CPI confirmed what we already intuitively know. But the folks over at the Federal Reserve continue to tell us there’s nothing to worry about. They insist inflation is transitory. Their reassurances notwithstanding, people are worried. Searches for the word “inflation” hit an all-time high on Google trends in May. In this clip from a recent podcast, Peter Schiff talked about the growing public worry about inflation and why the Fed’s response is bogus. According to Google Trends, searches for the word “inflation” hit the highest level since 2004 between May 9 and May 15. That’s as far back as the data goes. Google charts trends numerically and during that time period interest in “inflation” went all the way up to 100. “If you look all the way from 2004 until the end of 2020, pretty much all the searches were pretty consistent at about 50. And now, in the beginning of 2021, is where we shot up from 50 all the way up to 100. So, something changed in 2021 that resulted in all these people all over the United States deciding independently that they were going to search inflation.” So, why are they doing that? “Well, because they’re worried about it! If it was transitory, would they care? They care because it doesn’t seem like it’s transitory.” On the other hand, the Federal Reserve continues to ignore the signs that inflation is here to stay and pretends it’s transitory. “We can’t just pretend and play make-believe and hope the problem goes away. Because they tried that with the mortgage problem. Even though it was obvious that subprime was the tip of a huge iceberg, the Fed kept saying, ‘Don’t worry. It’s contained,’ because they were hoping that if they denied the problem, maybe it would go away. Well, they’re doing the same thing again with inflation. They’re telling all the people who are so worried about inflation, ‘Hey, don’t worry about it because it’s just transitory.’ Well, it’s as transitory as subprime was contained.” In fact, the Fed is driving inflation through its monetary policy and debt monetization. Through the first 7 months of fiscal 2021, the US government collected about $2.1 trillion in taxes but spent about $4.1 trillion. “That means $2 trillion was borrowed and basically funded by the Federal Reserve. And these are the official numbers. The unofficial numbers are even worse.” And consider this: the deficit through the first 7 months of 2021 is higher than the first 7 months of 2020, which included the depth of the COVID recession. “The government is spending even more money and running even bigger deficits now, when the economy is supposedly in recovery, than it was when it was still in recession, which again proves that there isn’t a recovery at all. It’s phony. The only reason the economy looks like it’s recovering is because the Fed is printing all this money to artificially stimulate it. But the way you see the truth is to look at the increase in prices that the Fed is still denying exist. They don’t want to acknowledge that inflation is not transitory because then they have to acknowledge that it’s the recovery that’s transitory because it doesn’t actually exist and inflation is going to kill it.” This puts the Fed in an awkward position. Typically, the cure for a recession is inflation. But how can the Fed cure a recession caused by inflation by creating more inflation? “The hair of the dog that bit you isn’t going to work. It’s just going to make the economy sicker.” Alex Jones breaks down critical intel regarding Covid-19 and the infamous Wuhan lab.",0,1

"Scientist At Center Of Lab Leak Controversy Put In Charge Of The Lancet’s Task Force To Investigate Virus Origin Revered scientific journal The Lancet has created a ‘task force’ to investigate the origins of the coronavirus that caused a global pandemic, yet it has decided to employ as its leader the very guy who funded the dangerous gain of function research at the Wuhan lab and subsequently allegedly ‘bullied’ other scientists into avoiding looking into the lab as a potential source of the outbreak. In the wake of renewed scrutiny of the lab leak hypothesis, the Lancet’s task force will reportedly “focus on analyzing data on all of the theories put forward on the origins of COVID, on the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 was able to break out of Wuhan and spread globally, and on the most plausible strategies to prevent future pandemics.” It also states that “The Task Force will review thoroughly and objectively all publicly available evidence, particularly the peer-reviewed literature, and conduct interviews with key leaders in science, medicine, policy and civil society.” ‘Objectively’. Right. Dr Peter Daszak, who is heading up this task force, is perhaps the least suitable scientist on the planet to objectively analyse the data, given his track record. Daszak, as President of the EcoHealth Alliance, shovelled at least $600,000 to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the past few years to play around with coronaviruses inside the lab through the now infamous ‘gain of function’ research. Daszak, who also works for the World Health Organisation, is on record admitting that he was involved with manipulating coronaviruses. Here is a video of him talking in DECEMBER 2019 about how ‘good’ the viruses are for altering in a lab: Daszak notes that “coronaviruses are pretty good… you can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily… the spiked proteins drive a lot about what happens. You can get the sequence you can build the protein, we work with Ralph Baric at UNC to do this, insert into the backbone of another virus and do some work in a lab.” No wonder then that Daszak as lead investigator for the WHO investigation determined within 3 hours of visiting the Wuhan lab in February 2021 that there was ‘nothing to see here’? Recently released emails now document that Daszak thanked Dr Fauci for dismissing the lab leak theory before any scientific research had been done on the possibility. Daszak was later employed as an ‘expert fact checker’ by Facebook when it was monitoring and removing ‘misinformation’ about the origins of COVID on its platform, much of which was credible scientific research. Facebook has since reversed the policy of banning any posts containing information suggesting COVID-19 was “man-made”. Daszak’s Twitter profile is basically one long ‘it came from bats not a lab’ thread, much to the annoyance of some other scientists: Having approved the awarding of NIH funding to Wuhan Institute of Virology–twice–Fauci has a massive conflict of interest on subject.Failure to disclose this conflict of interest represents journalistic malpractice.— Richard H. Ebright (@R_H_Ebright) May 5, 2020 Why does this guy keep getting put in charge of investigations, task forces and ‘fact checking’, when it’s abundantly clear that he has the biggest motive to dismiss the lab leak notion? As microbiologist Professor Richard Ebright has noted, “Daszak was the contractor who funded the laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology that potentially was the source of the virus with subcontracts from $200million [£142million] from the US Department of State and $7million [£5million] from the US National Institutes of Health and he was a collaborator and co-author on research projects at the laboratory.” Daszak has already lied about the type of research that was being conducted at the Wuhan lab, claiming, after the outbreak happened, that he didn’t know if it was gain of function or not. His own previous statements, and the Fauci emails prove he knew full well what was going on in the lab. In addition, as reported by The Daily Mail and other outlets, Daszak “orchestrated a ‘bullying’ campaign and coerced top scientists into signing off on a letter to The Lancet aimed at removing blame for Covid-19 from the Wuhan lab he was funding with US money.” Daszak used his influence to get the journal to publish the letter, which stated that to even suggest the lab leak theory had any credibility was equal to spreading “fear, rumours, and prejudice.” It effetely shut down discussion among the scientific ‘consensus’ of the lab leak potential for a whole year until intelligence findings brought the matter back to the attention of the mainstream media. WHO scientific advisor Jamie Metzl described Daszak’s letter as “scientific propaganda and a form of thuggery and intimidation.” “By labelling anyone with different views a conspiracy theorist, the Lancet letter was the worst form of bullying in full contravention of the scientific method,” Metzl added. The letter further stated that “We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin,” and even had the audacity to state that “We declare no competing interests.” Indeed, Daszak had made sure that the letter would be devoid of any link to EcoHealth, and even considered leaving his own name off it, emails released via the Freedom of Information Act have revealed. To make matters worse, the other members of The Lancet’s task force are practically all minions of Daszak, some of whom helped him draft the letter that unequivocally stated the lab leak theory was dangerous, and others who either worked with him on ‘fact checking’ for Facebook, or were cited as sources during that activity. Taking all this into account, it is obvious what the outcome of The Lancet’s inquiry will be, and it should not and cannot be used as credible evidence against the lab leak theory.

"Millennials Getting Too Old to Build Wealth In “almost every way measurable,” millennials are getting too old to build wealth, according to a new Bloomberg report. The oldest millennials – now around 40 – are financially worse off than previous generations and they’re only 80% as wealthy as their parents were at the same age. This demographic has been hit by two major recessions during what are traditionally peak saving and investing years. “They were 27-years-old when Lehman Bros. went bankrupt, and the Great Recession dug in when they should have been establishing themselves in the workforce,” writes Bloomberg’s Olivia Rockeman and Catarina Saraiva. William Gale, a senior fellow in the Economic Studies Program at the Brookings Institution adds: “The Great Recession knocked everyone for a loop. It caused unemployment. It caused slow wage growth. It made it harder to accumulate wealth.” Then, at a time when people typically move into higher-paying managerial roles, the nation’s economy was shutdown due to the “pandemic.” “In 2020, the U.S. economy contracted 3.5%; When the oldest Baby Boomers turned 40 in 1986, the U.S. economy expanded at a 3.5% rate.” Now, Americans are concerned about the diminishing value of the U.S. dollar more than ever before. Economist Peter Schiff of SchiffGold.com writes: According to Google Trends, searches for the word “inflation” hit the highest level since 2004 between May 9 and May 15. That’s as far back as the data goes.

Yes. Can you catch up? Yes,” says Juan G. HernandezAriano of WealthCreate, a financial advising firm in Texas. “How? First and foremost, defining your goals.” “Once you define your goals: build a budget, improve that budget, diversity not only from an investment perspective but an income perspective.” Alex Jones breaks down critical intel regarding Covid-19 and the infamous Wuhan lab.",0,1

But I will always be proud of what we accomplished for the American people over the last four years.” Elsewhere in his speech to the Hillsborough County Lincoln-Reagan Dinner, Pence slammed the Biden-Harris administration’s agenda which he said was dismantling all the advancements made by the Trump administration. “We made history. We made a difference. We made America greater than ever before,” Pence said describing his and Trump’s reign after being introduced by New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R). “But how times have changed. You know the governor said he didn’t come here to bash the current administration. Well I did.” Declaring “enough is enough,” Pence outlined how “the Biden administration and Democrats in Washington have been pushing open borders, higher taxes, runaway spending, more government, defunding the police, abandoning the right to life, censoring free speech, [and] canceling our most cherished liberties.” “In 2020, you remember Joe Biden was campaigning as a moderate when he campaigned, but he’s literally governed as the most liberal president since FDR,” Pence stated. “So buckle up. I mean 134 days, and the Biden-Harris administration has launched an avalanche of big government liberal policies, the likes of which I’ve never even imagined I’d see in our lifetime, and all of it designed to derail the progress that we made over the last four years.” Watch Pence’s full speech below: Exclusive: Mike Pence Threatened Trump With 25th Amendment Removal If He Didn’t Concede Fraudulent Election",0,1
"Front-row view reveals exceptional cosmic explosion Scientists have gained the best view yet of the brightest explosions in the universe: A specialized observatory in Namibia has recorded the most energetic radiation and longest gamma-ray afterglow of a so-called gamma-ray burst (GRB) to date. The observations with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) challenge the established idea of how gamma-rays are produced in these colossal stellar explosions which are the birth cries of black holes, as the international team reports in the journal Science. “Gamma-ray bursts are bright X-ray and gamma-ray flashes observed in the sky, emitted by distant extragalactic sources,” explains DESY scientist Sylvia Zhu, one of the authors of the paper. “They are the biggest explosions in the universe and associated with the collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star to a black hole. A fraction of the liberated gravitational energy feeds the production of an ultrarelativistic blast wave. Their emission is divided into two distinct phases: an initial chaotic prompt phase lasting tens of seconds, followed by a long-lasting, smoothly fading afterglow phase.” On 29 August 2019 the satellites Fermi and Swift detected a gamma-ray burst in the constellation of Eridanus. The event, cataloged as GRB 190829A according to its date of occurrence, turned out to be one of the nearest gamma-ray bursts observed so far, with a distance of about one billion lightyears. For comparison: The typical gamma-ray burst is about 20 billion lightyears away. “We were really sitting in the front row when this gamma-ray burst happened,” explains co-author Andrew Taylor from DESY. The team caught the explosion’s afterglow immediately when it became visible to the H.E.S.S. telescopes. “We could observe the afterglow for several days and to unprecedented gamma-ray energies,” reports Taylor. The comparatively short distance to this gamma-ray burst allowed detailed measurements of the afterglow’s spectrum, which is the distribution of “colors,” or photon energies, of the radiation in the very-high energy range. “We could determine GRB 190829A’s spectrum up to an energy of 3.3 tera-electronvolts, that’s about a trillion times as energetic as the photons of visible light,” explains co-author Edna Ruiz-Velasco from the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg. “This is what’s so exceptional about this gamma-ray burst—it happened in our cosmic backyard where the very-high-energy photons were not absorbed in collisions with background light on their way to Earth, as it happens over larger distances in the cosmos.” The team could follow the afterglow up to three days after the initial explosion. The result came as a surprise: “Our observations revealed curious similarities between the X-ray and very-high energy gamma-ray emission of the burst’s afterglow,” reports Zhu. Established theories assume that the two emission components must be produced by separate mechanisms: the X-ray component originates from ultra-fast electrons that are deflected in the strong magnetic fields of the burst’s surroundings. This “synchrotron” process is quite similar to how particle accelerators on Earth produce bright X-rays for scientific investigations. However, according to existing theories it seemed very unlikely that even the most powerful explosions in the universe could accelerate electrons enough to directly produce the observed very-high-energy gamma rays. This is due to a “burn-off limit,” which is determined by the balance of acceleration and cooling of particles within an accelerator. Producing very-high energy gamma-rays requires electrons with energies well beyond the burn-off limit. Instead, current theories assume that in a gamma-ray burst, fast electrons collide with synchrotron photons and thereby boost them to gamma-ray energies in a process dubbed synchrotron self-Compton. But the observations of GRB 190829A’s afterglow now show that both components, X-ray and gamma ray, faded in sync. Also, the gamma-ray spectrum clearly matched an extrapolation of the X-ray spectrum. Together, these results are a strong indication that X-rays and very-high-energy gamma rays in this afterglow were produced by the same mechanism. “It is rather unexpected to observe such remarkably similar spectral and temporal characteristics in the X-ray and very-high energy gamma-ray energy bands, if the emission in these two energy ranges had different origins,” says co-author Dmitry Khangulyan from Rikkyo University in Tokyo. This poses a challenge for the synchrotron self-Compton origin of the very-high energy gamma-ray emission. The far-reaching implication of this possibility highlights the need for further studies of very-high energy GRB afterglow emission. GRB 190829A is only the fourth gamma-ray burst detected from the ground. However, the earlier detected explosions occurred much farther away in the cosmos and their afterglow could only be observed for a few hours each and not to energies above 1 tera-electronvolts (TeV). “Looking to the future, the prospects for the detection of gamma-ray bursts by next-generation instruments like the Cherenkov Telescope Array that is currently being built in the Chilean Andes and on the Canary Island of La Palma look promising,” says H.E.S.S. spokesperson Stefan Wagner from Landessternwarte Heidelberg. “The general abundance of gamma-ray bursts leads us to expect that regular detections in the very-high energy band will become rather common, helping us to fully understand their physics.”",0,1
"Trump Responds After Facebook Confirms At Least Two-Year Ban President Donald Trump criticized Facebook after a company official revealed they’ll keep him blocked on their platform for at least two years. “Facebook’s ruling is an insult to the record-setting 75M people, plus many others, who voted for us in the 2020 Rigged Presidential Election,” the president wrote in a statement on Friday. “They shouldn’t be allowed to get away with this censoring and silencing, and ultimately, we will win. Our Country can’t take this abuse anymore!” On Friday, Facebook vice president of global affairs Nick Clegg told Politico the president’s account would be suspended for two years after the company claimed he incited violence on Jan. 6. “We are suspending his accounts for two years, effective from the date of the initial suspension on January 7 this year,” Clegg told Politico. “Given the gravity of the circumstances that led to Mr. Trump’s suspension, we believe his actions constituted a severe violation of our rules which merit the highest penalty available under the new enforcement protocols,” he added. Fortunately, there’s a major silver lining in that timetable for Trump, according to Politico. The social media giant said after that period it would evaluate whether “the risk to public safety has receded,” and then make a call on his possible reinstatement. Facebook said that when the suspension is “eventually” lifted, Trump could face a new set of sanctions if he breaks the social network’s rules again, ranging from one month to a potential permanent ban depending on severity of offense.The timetable means Trump could return to the platform ahead of a potential 2024 presidential run, a prospect he has teased he’s considering.

"NATO Chief Says Org Does NOT See China as Adversary, Will Include Beijing in New Strategy NATO does not consider China to be an adversary but will include the country in its New Strategic Concept for the first time ever, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday. “China is asserting itself on the global stage. NATO does not see China as an adversary. There are opportunities to engage with Beijing [on] issues like trade, climate change, and arms control”, Stoltenberg said during a virtual event organised by the Brookings Institution. “In the existing strategic concept of NATO, we don’t mention China with one single word. I can guarantee one thing that in the New Strategic Concept, China will be mentioned”. Stoltenberg noted that the future communique during the upcoming NATO summit on 14 June will contain “much more language” on China than ever before, including specific decisions that will address Beijing’s technological advances and ways to protect NATO member states’ key infrastructure against possible cyber threats. In addition, Stoltenberg said NATO recognises the shift in the global balance of power as a result of the rise of China that has caused a number of security issues, including the fact the alliance has become more important to the United States.

"The Economics of the Extended Family: From Risk Management to Human Capital When we think of analyzing economic organizations, we generally think of firms and corporations. But there is another organization that is just as critical to economic development: the extended family. Indeed, the advantages offered by this institution are numerous and include risk sharing, mutual aid, human capital building, social capital building, and resource complementarity and coordination. Risk Sharing and Mutual Aid One of the most important roles of the extended family is to act as a risk-sharing organization. Life is unpredictable. In a nuclear family separated from the extended family, the parents only have one another to rely upon. A single accident, sudden illness, job loss, etc. reduces half of the productive capacity of this unit and can spell disaster for both spouses and their dependent children. This is where grandparents, uncles, aunts, and even family friends and close neighbors serve a crucial societal function. The members of this large group can chip in when things are going well for them to help their family members who are going through hard times. And those who contribute know that if one day it’s their turn to go through a rough patch, the rest of the extended family, with its large collective pool of resources, will be there to get them through it, too. This works like and is a supplement to insurance purchased on the market, except that in the extended family there’s an affectionate thumb on the actuary’s scale. Moving from a small group like the nuclear family to a larger group like the extended family protects against risk, because while it only takes one misfortune for half of a nuclear family to be debilitated, it would be an unlikely coincidence for half of a thirty-person extended family to simultaneously be stricken by misfortunes. The mutual-aid capacity of the extended family doesn’t just apply to extraordinary cases such as sudden illness, unemployment, or death, but also to everyday matters such as taking care of the very young and the very old members of the family. We see this, for example, in the familiar case of grandparents caring for and instructing their grandchildren when the parents are at work or running errands. The extended family is like a company that provides health insurance, unemployment insurance, life insurance, childcare, and eldercare all in one and in which everyone on the board of directors loves you. Human and Social Capital The benefits hardly stop there. The extended family is also an engine of human and social capital, that is to say skills and connections that boost the career opportunities of its members. Imagine a young man, Smith, who in addition to his parents has a grandfather who runs a vineyard, another grandfather who’s a carpenter, an uncle who owns a mechanic shop, another uncle who’s a lawyer, an aunt who’s a nurse, and older cousins with their own occupations and businesses. To an outsider with no such relatives, each one of these occupational or entrepreneurial paths is to varying extents a black box. Is this the right path for me? What skills do I need? How do I get started? Who do I need to talk to? And so on. But for Smith, each of his relatives can provide an apprenticeship opportunity and be a fountain of insider knowledge and connections. The extended family members in question can offer advice, describe what the occupation is like, take him in as an intern and teach him the craft, recommend him for job openings, or hire him themselves. All of this can save Smith a world of time, money, and anxiety and missteps. According to Julia Fisher, the director of education research at the Clayton Christensen Institute, “Research shows that 70% of all jobs are not published publicly on jobs sites and as much as 80% of jobs are filled through personal and professional connections.” This shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Parents pay large sums of money for their children to make the social connections provided by elite universities, for example. Having a devoted extended family presents many of the advantages of a vocational school, country club, or recruitment agency. Complementarity of Resources In a prior article I discussed how specialization and the division of labor make the family a powerful economic unit. Jörg Guido Hülsmann provides an insight about resource complementarity within the family that extends this analysis: The generations are also different; they also complement each other. Young people typically have a large work capacity and creativity, but less experience and money. The cooperation between the generations of a family is also favored by trust and affection that has grown over many years, which still has to be built up in relation to people who are not family members. The young and the old tend to have complementary resources within the family: energy and money, respectively. There may be plenty of people in the world ready to offer money to finance investments, and there may be plenty of people in the world ready to execute business plans once they have the money for it, but solving the coordination problem of bringing together these groups of people and fostering enough trust between them to breathe life into these potential investments is a herculean task. It’s part of the reason why there’s a multitrillion-dollar global banking industry. Within extended families, the fact that the young and the old develop affection toward, trust in, and knowledge of one another helps solve this resource coordination problem. Consequently, investment ideas become actual investments. Conclusion These benefits can’t be taken for granted, however. Merely having biological grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. is not the same as being a part of a functioning extended family if this group of people is scattered across different states, or doesn’t labor to maintain warm relations and fulfill their reciprocal obligations toward one another. That’s up to us.",0,1
"New York Politicians Have No Idea How to Fix the Subways The misery will continue for New York subway riders, who don’t understand how previous subway reforms have failed. State and city officials concede things will worsen. “There is no question our subways are in crisis after decades of underinvestment and inaction,” wrote New York City Comptroller Scott Stinger in a recent report. “The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA),” writes New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli in a report last year, “is facing its greatest challenge in decades.” Riders, he warned[,] “are abandoning the system for other transportation alternatives.” And the problems will continue for years. “Citing the MTA’s low debt service coverage in the near term and its challenging funding issues, Standard & Poor’s recently downgraded the MTA’s credit rating, which could lead to higher borrowing costs. Debt service is already projected to increase by 26 percent over the next four years, reaching nearly $3.3 billion by 2022,” according to the DiNapoli report. “Debt service,” DiNapoli wrote, “has been growing rapidly since the early 2000s.” Yet the red-ink woes of the government trains had been going on for many years before that. Stringer, who is critical of the subways but against any privatization, says bad subway service hurts the area’s economy. Losses range “from $170 million to $389 million” a year. And that was before the coronavirus crisis. Yet no state or city official says anything about bringing the private sector back into the subways. Its first lines were built by private companies, made lots of money, and helped clear slums in lower Manhattan as people were able to move to better neighborhoods. Yet the government-run subways, again on the verge of disaster, will follow the same solution even though it repeatedly failed over decades: More taxpayer money. Here’s what one subway historian wrote of the previous “give the subway more taxpayer money” plans: “If anything has emerged as a timeless and universal characterization of the New York Subway,” writes historian Brian Cudahy, “it is the endless search for some future salvation, some not realized resolution of its difficulties and cure for its ills. Plans are made, programs developed, goals established. But they never quite live up to their initial expectations, and a new cycle must begin.” Cudahy, who was also a former federal transit official, is against privatization. The MTA recently approved the biggest capital plan in the agency’s history; some $51 billion. MTA Managing Director Ronnie Hakim, promised that “enhancements” to the system would “improve the riders’ daily experience.” Dear Riders, Has Your Experience Improved? But most of this extra money, as the sad subway history repeats, will not be spent on better trains, but on servicing the huge amount of debt of the government agency running the system. For instance, how many people know that three separate Second Avenue Subway bond issues were approved over some 60 years—in the 1950s, 1960s, and recently under Gov. George Pataki—yet, in the case of the first two the money had to be spent on closing the subway deficit? As for the third bond issue, very little of the new line has been completed and who knows when this infamous Line—which was designed to replace the Second and Third Ave. els, which were taken down in the 1950s and 1960s—will ever be finished? Yet again the state agency that runs the subways, which in the 1960s replaced the city agency that made a mess of running them, says it is deep in the hole even with more money coming. The MTA, already in the midst of a new cash infusion, wants the federal government to provide billions more on top of that $51 billion, with service deteriorating and MTA officials saying the red ink could possibly lead to something I can’t recall ever threatened before in previous crises: Lines discontinued! Yet our political and media elites today have the same answer as 70 years ago: Give more money to this flawed system and ban the private sector. Actually, I would argue that, as with so many other failing government services in so much trouble, it is no longer a philosophical debate. Privatization is inevitable, given the messes created by decades of a government-run enterprise. Yet any privatization is verboten in New York’s increasingly socialist economy. Our leaders push various price controls. They are hostile to the privatization of anything. Impossibilities In the subways their opposition is based on a historical myth: “Private subways, private transportation companies, can never make money.” I have been told this many times. Is the private-transportation argument valid? No. The IRT [Interborough Rapid Transit Company] was a private management company that had a subway-franchise contract with the city. It built the first subways, which were considered “an engineering marvel” by Robert Caro in his biography of the controversial New York bureaucrat Robert Moses. “So superbly engineered and maintained had the system previously been that it took years for the systematic neglect to take its toll,” Caro wrote. But in the last decade or so of the IRT, the company that built the first subways did lose money and wanted to sell to the city. Why? The IRT, in its nearly 37 years of existence, was never permitted to raise the fare above a nickel. That fare was quickly and frequently raised once the city, and later the state, took over the subways. The use of price controls, along with punishing regulation, is the classic case of how socialism comes in the back door without anyone’s mentioning the word “Marx.” However, the journalists and political elites in our city either don’t know or want to hide some painful history about the subways. In the first 25 years or so of the IRT it made money—a lot of money. (By contrast, a government-run competing system, the IND [Independent Subway System], always lost money.) Indeed, in the IRT’s 1917 annual report, the transportation company reported net income of $23.2 million. That was an increase of about $1.5 million over the previous year. The IRT was also a good investment. It paid some $7 million in dividends, according to the annual financial report dated June 30, 1917. Profits and Dividends through Subway Operations? Yes. And even into the 1920s, when price controls and rising costs as a result of World War I squeezed profits, when the private operators sued to raise fares, the subways still made money. But the IRT could see problems coming. World War I had driven up costs and the nickel fare was insufficient. In a U.S. Supreme Court decision of 1929, Gilchrist v. IRT, a decision that affirmed that the five-cent fare couldn’t be raised to seven cents, court papers documented that the IRT was doing something that the government would never do: The IRT made money. “For the current fiscal year ended June 30, 1928, the figures for the first six months are available, and show a net surplus amounting to $3,687,000, which exceeds the surplus for the corresponding six months of the fiscal year before by $1,609,000.” However, after the IRT was repeatedly blocked from raising fares, the price-controlled subways lost money in the 1930s. Soon, we were on the track of a perpetual government-run system: It meant then what it means today and will always mean: Lose a lot and provide rotten service. But what if we continue down this same road of throwing more taxpayer geld down the sewer? More cutbacks and fare and tax increases will come in the current system as riders continue to suffer. Privatization is the only road back to the days when the subways were considered an engineering marvel. The subway system could and should be handed back over the private sector. It doesn’t have to be this way, a way in which people despair of having to ride this state-run nightmare. In fact, there was a time when the subways were great under a private management company. The people who run the city don’t want people to ever know that. They don’t want them to ever learn the true history of markets, which consistently provide better services than the government. They will then want—perhaps even demand—a privately owned, privately run subway system.",0,1
"Muslim neighbourhoods in British towns are ‘no-go areas’ for white people, new book claims An academic who studied Muslim integration in Britain has revealed in a new book that women and children in some communities are subjected to Taliban-like rules, and non-Muslims face threats of violence. Ed Husain, professor at the Walsh School of Foreign Service in Georgetown University, visited mosques across Britain, speaking to businesses owners, imams and locals about life in predominantly Muslim neighbourhoods. He used his on-the-ground research to write a book, ‘Among The Mosques: A Journey Across Muslim Britain’, which is set for release next week. The Muslim author grew up in a Bangladeshi family in London and was radicalised in his youth before renouncing extremism. According to the professor, integration issues in the UK continue to persist. One man in Blackburn told Husain that “Asian” teengers repeatedly “jumped” his 12-year-old son simply for “being white.” Another local told the author that certain parts of the town had become “no-go areas.” Blackburn has the largest Muslim population in the UK outside of London, and is a major hub for ultra-orthodox Islamic sects. Husain also learned that one school in the town had barred girls from participating in swimming lessons, saying that it was inappropriate for them to be seen in bathing costumes. While visiting a bookstore in Blackburn, the author stumbled across several volumes advocating strict restrictions and dress codes for women, as well as copies of a book which argued that it is sinful to enjoy dancing and listening to music. The town also reportedly has restaurants that provide gender separation for their clientele. While visiting Bradford, Husain was amazed by how few white residents there were, and was reportedly told by a taxi driver that they had “gone with the wind.” He noted that mosques were on nearly every corner and that even private homes served as places of worship and religious schools. The professor also learned that some Muslim parents in the area had prohibited their children from going to drawing and dance lessons. An imam in the city confided that there was “widespread abuse of disabled children in the Muslim community,” and that parents were pocketing social welfare money while neglecting their children. In Didsbury, the author came across a sign for a local ‘Sharia Department’, which deals with marital issues and other disputes through the lens of Islamic law. He reported similar interactions and situations in places like Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. One woman told him that some Muslim communities in the UK had become a “different universe” from the rest of the country. Like other European countries, the UK has struggled with integrating immigrants from Muslim-majority nations, sparking concern about radicalisation. At the same time, reports suggest that there is a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment in the country. During Husain’s trip to Bradford, a local predicted that anti-Muslim sentiment could lead to “an apartheid city” within 30 years and give rise to Nazi-like political parties that would persecute immigrants.",0,1
"Texas Bill Banning Tenets of Critical Race Theory and Action Civics Sent to Governor The Texas legislature has approved a bill that would ban the teaching of concepts associated with Critical Race Theory and “action civics.” The bill has now been sent to Gov. Greg Abbott (R). In an interview with Yahoo News published Friday, Texas state Rep. Steve Toth (R), the primary author of House Bill 3979, said the bill is in keeping with the message of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. “This bill is a direct reflection of the 1964 Civil Rights Act,” Toth said. “It echoes Dr. King’s wish that we should judge people on the content of their character, not their skin.” The bill prohibits teachers from discussing concepts related to Critical Race Theory (CRT), a Marxist philosophy that embraces the notion that all social and cultural issues should be viewed through the lens of race. The legislation particularly bans teaching or discussing the ideas that “one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex,” or that “an individual, by virtue of the individuals’ race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex.” The bill prohibits teaching that “an individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of the individual ’s race or sex.” Additionally, the measure states teachers cannot be forced to discuss current events in their classes. If they do so, they must “strive to explore the topic from diverse and contending perspectives without giving deference to any one perspective.” “The more people learn about critical race theory, whether Republican or Democrat, the more they oppose it,” Toth said. In another interview with the Houston Chronicle, Toth said CRT is “about profiling our children to promote strife and anger at one another and hatred.” The Texas lawmaker said that while the name of Critical Race Theory does not appear in the bill, what it prohibits are “prejudicial things that were outlawed in the 1964 Civil Rights movement, like discriminating against someone because of their race or sex.” Read more.",0,1

"World Economic Forum pushes MIT program that automatically detects “disinformation narratives” online Misinformation and propaganda are as old and as present as human communication and societies organized into states. The curiously intense focus on these the last couple of years prompts many to believe such issues are now used as justification and smokescreen for suppressing legitimate but unwanted speech, and free expression-related civil rights. Depending on where you stand on that, you may be reassured or dismayed that the World Economic Forum (WEF) is one of the entities pushing hard the agenda of online misinformation presenting a huge danger today – and endorsing some “solutions.” One comes from MIT and its “Reconnaissance of Influence Operations (RIO)” – now there’s a name George Orwell would probably not kick out of his novels. Out the gate, RIO “establishes” that power of misinformation on social networks and elsewhere online is such as to sway elections, but also allow different points of view to be expressed, or as the program announcement put it, “sow discord.” Another dangerous point the MIT program aims to address is disinformation feeding “conspiracy theories” – but in light of the recent embarrassing U-turn on the “Wuhan lab leak” there’s no evidence of a firm and consensus-based definition of what a “conspiracy” even is. Rather, the category seems prone to political whim. But RIO looks to be designed to work under the false premise that these definitions are objective, and agreed on by all stakeholders. You’d think that as far as conspiracies go, the one about Russians electing a US president by exploiting social media is the most tired and by now well-debunked one. Nevertheless, that is one of the claims to fame made by those behind RIO and MIT Lincoln Laboratory’s Artificial Intelligence Software Architectures and Algorithms Group, whose goal is not only to “automatically” detect what they deem to be disinformation, but also what their machine learning algorithms are programed to identify as “disinformation narratives.” That means the tool would recognize the level of influence of accounts not only by their size in terms of followers, but also other elements as a measure of overall impact. Recognize for what reason? Highly likely to censor and remove. “The team envisions RIO being used by both government and industry as well as beyond social media and in the realm of traditional media such as newspapers and television,” the WEF said on its website.",0,1
"EU looked at ‘importing 70 million Africans’ by 2035, says German MEP Gunnar Beck, denouncing ‘disastrous’ new migration pact A leading figure in Alternative for Germany, tipped for victory in a German election this week, Gunnar Beck is attacking the EU’s ‘deeply dangerous’ migration pact before it’s enacted under cover of a feelgood summer. As Germany’s ‘super election year’ focuses on the state of Saxony-Anhalt this Sunday, the disruptors in the nation’s biggest opposition party, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), are poised for a shock win as its anti-immigration message resonates in the heartlands of former East Germany. Sitting top of the most recent INSA opinion poll with 26% and having just announced its two lead candidates for September’s federal elections – both supporters of a hard line on immigration – AfD is not about to soften its message. Germany (Saxony-Anhalt regional election), INSA poll: AfD-ID: 26% (+2)CDU-EPP: 25% (-1)LINKE-LEFT: 13%GRÜNE-G/EFA: 11% (-1)SPD-S&D: 10%FDP-RE: 8% (+2) +/- vs. 20-27 Apr Fieldwork: 17-23 May 2021Sample size: 1,000➤ https://t.co/obOCVirbpF#ltwlsa #Ltw #ltwsa pic.twitter.com/swS8fdXXmf — Europe Elects (@EuropeElects) May 26, 2021 Senior AfD figure and Euro MP Gunnar Beck said a strong election result would prove a useful weapon in his party’s battle against the European Union’s controversial proposed Pact on Migration and Asylum that looks to enlist its members in a centrally-run redistribution of asylum seekers across the bloc. “I have myself been working on the EU migration pact for some time and for me the enactment of such a pact would be disastrous,” Beck told RT.com. “Because the EU not too long ago was talking about importing up to 70 million Africans into Europe by 2035. In my humble opinion this is not what we need to modernise our economy. “And while the figure seems high, when the members of our migration pact campaign – including delegates from Denmark, Estonia, France and Belgium – met with the Commission just last year, that migration figure was brought up but no one at the Commission chose to deny it. “ That suggestion of actively encouraging inward migration to the EU has been floating around Brussels for a while, as governments across the bloc look at ways to address the phenomenon known as the ‘greying of Europe’ where ageing populations aged 65 or older and low birthrates pose ‘considerable social, economic and political challenges in countries such as Germany and Italy’ according to the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank. Some politicians, such as former European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker believe an influx of younger workers from Africa is the solution. Meanwhile, the migration pact currently appears stuck in parliamentary committees, the received wisdom is that it’s being deliberately stalled until the outcome of the German federal elections is known in September. Beck suggests an alternative reason for the unusual delay. “It’s not gone through all the committees in the European Parliament and the negotiations of the Council [of Europe] haven’t started but I think the EU would like to push the legislation through from July onwards,” he said. “Now that all the countries are phasing out the lockdown and people are generally feeling better about themselves and able to leave their homes again. So the possibility is that they’ll try to use the general feelgood atmosphere – summer combined with corona relaxations – to push ahead with this deeply dangerous legislative package,” Beck said. And maybe Beck’s right. Because the European Parliament’s final plenary session is early July and then it doesn’t sit again until mid-September. If the pact proposals are put to MEPs in July and inevitably passed, there is plenty of time for it to lose its sting over the extended summer break. It will be just like it was there all the time. That should play well for AfD in the federal elections, which are slated for September 22, but Beck is not so sure. “It’s possible that migration will become an important issue in the federal election,” he said. “And the EU migration pact to those of us in the EU delegation is an important campaign but whether that can be turned into an election campaign is a different story.” Nevertheless, a win on Sunday for AfD would indicate that despite a huge surge in Green Party popularity nationwide, Germans are interested in more than climate change, particularly in states such as Saxony-Anhalt, home to one of Germany’s three main coal mines. A recent poll there found that climate change was considered important by just 6% of respondents, whereas a national survey found 75% of folk were concerned for the planet. Observers liken the voters of Saxony-Anhalt – which has a population of 2.2million – to those ‘left-behinds’ who Donald Trump wooed, and the so-called ‘Red Wall’ voters in the UK who felt their traditional party no longer represented them. Beck agrees. “The election this week will probably be the first time that we become the strongest single party and that will be a huge success,” he said. “There’s widespread dissatisfaction in east Germany about the state of politics in this country and that dissatisfaction can translate very frictionlessly into increasing support for the AfD because our party is not stigmatised there. In west Germany it’s distinctly more difficult there. The campaign to stigmatise us has been more successful and some of the other parties profit from that dissatisfaction. But not us.” Those efforts to discredit a party, which would most likely sit alongside the Conservative right in the UK, take a huge electoral toll. Despite coalitions being commonplace in Germany, no one dares buddy-up with AfD. So, despite topping last week’s poll in Saxony-Anhalt, even if AfD wins the greatest vote share on Sunday, it will be relegated to the opposition benches, thanks to a cosy three-party so-called ‘Kenya’ coalition agreement between the Greens, Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, nicknamed as such because their respective party colours of green, red and black echo the African nation’s flag. But an AfD victory will have some impact. It would prove no small embarrassment to the ruling establishment, particularly the CDU, who will be facing September’s elections without Angela Merkel and face their own internal battles as some members urge a tilt towards the right under the leadership of charisma-free Armin Laschet. At least for the time being, however, AfD will take the win and, while it will irk the party to be denied the seat of power, at least its supporters can be sure that they are making a difference.",0,1

"Chris Wallace Defends Fauci: Wuhan Lab Leak Emails Contain ‘No Smoking Gun’ Fox News anchor Chris Wallace defended Dr. Anthony Fauci on Friday following the release of thousands of his emails. The emails, released through the Freedom of Information Act, reveal Fauci had publicly lied about gain of function research funding and mask effectiveness, and actively downplayed the Wuhan lab leak theory despite growing evidence. “I’ve read reports and read through a number of the emails. There’s no smoking gun there that indicates that Fauci had any reason to believe this had come from the laboratory, from the Wuhan virology laboratory,” Wallace said on “America’s Newsroom.” “I’ll answer the question, even though Jen Psaki wouldn’t — this is highly political. I can promise you. You’re seeing it as a major talking point from Republicans. I think that when Donald Trump speaks tomorrow night in North Carolina, you’re going to see him go after Fauci.” Wallace then insisted Fauci had been “on the firing lines” since the 1980s over his public health recommendations during the AIDS pandemic. “Let’s just remember. Anthony Fauci has been on the firing lines trying to protect Americans from public health issues since the mid-80s with AIDS. And before we start calling for his head, this guy who’s been a devoted public servant for 40 years, maybe we ought to slow down just a little bit.” Reporter John Roberts chimed in, “Yeah, he is a survivor. There is no question about that.” Wallace shot back, “He is more than survivor. He’s a public servant John.” Is it standard practice for a public health expert to repeatedly lie to the public over research funding of a virus that caused a global pandemic, or about the efficacy of mask-wearing to protect from the coronavirus? Wallace and the Biden administration, who indicated Fauci will not be fired, seem to think so. Watch the full report on the gain of function confession by Peter Daszak here.",0,1
"Former Pentagon Official: U.S. Has Been Tracking UFOs for 70 YEARS Classified government documents soon to be made public show the United States has been tracking UFO crafts for 70 years, according to former Pentagon official Lue Elizondo. Elizondo made the bombshell revelation Friday on “Tucker Carlson Tonight”, noting that the long timeline essentially rules out the possibility that these advanced “tic-tac” aircraft belong to America, Russia, or China. “This is a document that was obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, and it demonstrates quite clearly that we have had issues with these UAPs [Unidentified Aerial Phenomena]…at least since 1950, probably earlier,” Elizondo told host Tucker Carlson. “And this is official US government correspondence. This isn’t some eyewitness report from a civilian. This is official government documentation from military personnel to very senior military brass.” Elizondo said the documents describe encounters with these aircraft “on a continuing basis” over “sensitive U.S. military facilities” with nuclear capabilities, and that the implications of the 70-year timeline reveal that these aircraft are not secret U.S. technology. “The U.S. government has finally admitted that this is not some sort of secret U.S. technology. But now there’s some wiggle room to say ‘well maybe it’s some sort of foreign adversarial technology,'” he said. “Here’s the problem with that theory: because we know that the Russians after the Berlin Wall came down, they shared a lot of information with us,” he continued. “There was this 5-year period or so, this new romance between us and Russia where they shared a lot of their UFO information with us. And by the way, they were seeing exactly the same thing in their skies that we were.” That leaves China as the only possible alternative, which Elizondo claimed is impossible when taking into account the state China was in during the 1950s: gripped in famine from the Great Leap Forward and with virtually no industrial technology. “You’re talking about a country that for somehow in 70 years, has kept this technology that was at least a thousand years ahead of us, kept it secret, was able to deploy it against us all the way back in 1950,” he noted, adding that encounters with these aircraft occurred more frequently once mankind entered the Atomic Age. It appears as if UFO technology is being made public.",0,1
"School Principal & Mobile Vaccine Bus Served With Notice of Liability For Pushing COVID Shot On Students A Hawaii school principal and his “vaccine supervisor” were served a Cease and Desist letter for attempting to administer the COVID-19 jab to students on campus. Radford High School principal James Sunday had approved of a vaccine campaign on school campus using a mobility clinic called the “Vax Squad” bus to inoculate the students with Pfizer’s COVID vaccine to students. Sunday and the “Vax Squad” supervisor named John received the Notice of Liability letter from the Council for Restorative Justice – a parental watchdog group – last month, explaining that they’ve violated a plethora of ethics codes for “unlawfully playing doctor” and failing to adequately provide informed consent. “In summation for the school campus staff along with ‘Vax Squad Bus’ administers, you are in breach of unlawful conversion of a tax-paying public-school facility licensed for the administering of education, not medication, and turning public school grounds into a medical treatment facility where drugs are being disseminated and inoculations performed,” the letter states. “You are in breach of not only turning public school grounds into medical treatment centers, but in breach of campaigning to adolescents, minors, youth, underaged children, sons and daughters, ages 17 and under, to receiving medical treatments.” “You are manipulating the medical decision of a minor, an underaged son or daughter,” the letter continues. “In addition to presenting false and misleading information about medical treatments, you are providing incentives and rewards, and coercive tactics to manipulate the minds of the minor to receiving these so-called ‘vaccines’ without giving full disclosure of all the potential risks of harm including death.” “It is imperative this program to facilitate the inoculations of the so-called COVID-19 “vaccine” be halted immediately and all decisions to expose any adolescents 17 and under, be arrested immediately,” the letter concludes. The letter includes a thorough breakdown of the legal, ethical, and constitutional violations brought about by promoting the Vax Squad to students, which can be read in detail below.

"Trump Advisor Unveils ‘America First Legal’ To Take On Biden Lawlessness Former Trump adviser Stephen Miller announced a new legal initiative to combat the left’s lawlessness in a non-profit described as the “conservative response” to the far-left American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The group, called America First Legal, has already taken on the Biden administration over a range of issues from illegal immigration to racial discrimination and civil liberties. During a wide-ranging interview with CNS News on Friday, Miller described how America First Legal is addressing Joe Biden’s attempt to collapse the southern border in violation of federal law. “We are a brand new organization and the way that I summarize it for people is that we are the conservative response to the ACLU,” Miller told host Rob Shimshock. “And so we saw for the last four-plus years, how every time President Trump tried to advance a policy — a lawful policy, in the case of our administration — the left ran to a court, typically, you know, in a place like San Francisco, to try to get an injunction from a left-leaning judge and stymie our ability to effectuate conservative policy for the country. And there really isn’t any parallel to this or hasn’t been for conservatives.” “Of course, the most important distinction between what the ACLU is doing and what we, as a brand new organization are doing: they went to court to prevent the administration from engaging in lawful conduct; we’re going to court to try to stop this administration from engaging in unlawful conduct,” Miller noted. Miller went on to explain how America First Legal aims to hold Biden accountable to the law as written by Congress. “And really, it comes down to a fundamental question, which is: does a president have the authority to suspend by edict, laws that have already been passed and adopted and signed by a previous administration? The answer, of course, is resoundingly no,” Miller said. “There’s only one way a president can block law and that is before the law is enacted, he can veto it. It’s all spelled out clearly in the Constitution. He can veto a law, prior to enactment, when the bill is sent to his desk and if Congress cannot muster the votes to override it, then that law doesn’t, in fact, become law, or the bill does not become law. Once passed, a president has no authority whatsoever to suspend, rewrite, or nullify duly enacted law.” “So this really is a core constitutional issue about the president’s fundamental obligation in the Constitution to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” he added. Miller went on describe how the left uses the law as a weapon to bludgeon their political enemies with rather than execute it in good faith. “And it’s really the heart of the divide in America right now, which is that the hard left views the law as simply an instrument to advance their own agenda and objectives. It’s just another tool,” Miller said. “In other words, it doesn’t have any inherent guidelines or structures built around it. It’s a sword; it’s a weapon. Wield it however you want, point it wherever you want, hurt whoever you want to hurt. In other words, they don’t think of it like ‘oh, we better have all these self-imposed restraints so we’re in power, not hurt anybody for political reason’; they say ‘no, if this is a tool we have then use it, just like the media is a tool, if Wall Street financing is a tool, if corporate America is a tool, then the law is a tool.'” This is the massive abuse of power coming out of Washington DC that is seeking to intimidate conservatives and law-abiding citizens across the country.",0,1
"Federal Judge Overturns California’s ‘Unconstitutional’ Ban On Assault Weapons Liberals are probably having a meltdown after a George W. Bush-appointed federal judge in California ruled the state’s ban on assault weapons is unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez of San Diego released a 94-page ruling late Friday, indicating California’s three-decade ban on assault weapons violates the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms. “Like the Swiss Army Knife, the popular AR-15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment. Good for both home and battle, the AR-15 is the kind of versatile gun that lies at the intersection of the kinds of firearms protected under District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008) and the United States v Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939),” Benitez wrote.“Yet, the State of California makes it a crime to have an AR15 type rifle,” Benitez continued. “Therefore, this Court declares the California statutes to be unconstitutional.” On several pages of the ruling, the judge recommended the rifle should be protected under the Second Amendment for its “militia readiness.” “Government is not free to impose its own new policy choices on American citizens where constitutional rights are concerned,” he added. “California may certainly conceive of a policy that a modern rifle is dangerous in the hands of a criminal, and that therefore it is good public policy to keep modern rifles out of the hands of every citizen. The Second Amendment stands as a shield from government imposition of that policy.” The office of Attorney General Rob Bonta released a statement after the ruling said it would immediately appeal the decision. “Today’s decision is fundamentally flawed, and we will be appealing it,” Bonta said in a statement Friday night. “There is no sound basis in law, fact, or common sense for equating assault rifles with swiss army knives.” The Firearms Policy Coalition, which supported the suit, praised the judge’s decision. “We look forward to continuing this challenge at the Ninth Circuit and, should it be necessary, the Supreme Court,” the group’s president, Brandon Combs, said in a statement. The outcome angered Gov. Gavin Newsom. He released a statement that read: “The fact that this judge compared the AR-15 — a weapon of war that’s used on the battlefield — to a Swiss Army Knife completely undermines the credibility of this decision and is a slap in the face to the families who’ve lost loved ones to this weapon,” he said. Benitez left plenty of time, about 30 days, for the attorney general to appeal, but we did find some irony in the July 4th date that the decision will take effect. Additionally, as Jonathan Turley noted, the decision could have some ramifications in the pending nomination of Chipman as Director of the ATF. Chipman is a former ATF special agent and senior policy adviser for the gun control organization Giffords. In his hearing, Chipman declared that “With respect to the AR-15, I support a ban as it has been presented in a Senate bill and supported by the president. The AR-15 is a gun I was issued on ATF’s SWAT team. It’s a particularly lethal weapon and regulating it as other particular lethal weapons I have advocated for.” Chipman was confronted on the definition of what constitutes an assault weapon. He told the Senate that the ATF defines an assault rifle as “any semi-automatic rifle capable of accepting a detachable magazine above the caliber of .22, which would include a .223, which is, you know largely the AR-15 round.” President Biden’s ATF nominee is eager to ban basically every single modern sporting rifle in America today. pic.twitter.com/iFrCUS6GYW— Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) May 26, 2021 That would include a wide array of weapons. Indeed, a statement by Judge Benitez may resonate with some senators: “This case is not about extraordinary weapons lying at the outer limits of Second Amendment protection. The banned ‘assault weapons’ are not bazookas, howitzers, or machine guns. Those arms are dangerous and solely useful for military purposes. Instead, the firearms deemed “assault weapons” are fairly ordinary, popular, modern rifles. This is an average case about average guns used in average ways for average purposes.One is to be forgiven if one is persuaded by news media and others that the nation is awash with murderous AR-15 assault rifles. The facts, however, do not support this The characterization of a finding as one of ‘fact’ or ‘law’ is not controlling. To the extent that a finding is characterized as one of ‘law’ but is more properly characterized as one of ‘fact; (or vice versa), substance prevails over form. hyperbole, and facts matter. Federal Bureau of Investigation murder statistics do not track assault rifles, but they do show that killing by knife attack is far more common than murder by any kind of rifle.” In fairness to Chipman, he made clear that he would enforce whatever the federal law prescribes in terms of any ban or the underlying definitions. However, he is viewed as an outspoken advocate for banning ownership of weapons like the AR-15, which was just declared as protected by this court. These are difficult policies and difficult cases. Reasonable people can disagree, including on the meaning of the Second Amendment. What is troubling is the level of misleading and frankly disingenuous discussion of the issue. The public is constantly being told that electing certain politicians will result in sweeping gun control when the current case law directly contradict such assertions. That was the case in the 2020 Democratic debates where candidates make unsupportable claims and promise. For example, now President Joe Biden attacked Senator Bernie Sanders over a vote that had favored the gun industry. Biden declared that, since the vote, 150 million Americans have been killed by guns. When people asked the campaign about roughly half of our population dying in gun violence, it said that number was probably more like 150,000. Nevertheless, many of the candidates promised massive changes. Biden declared “I want to tell you, if I’m elected NRA, I’m coming for you, and, gun manufacturers, I’m going to take you on and I’m going to beat you.” Beto O’Rourke ran on the issue and most famously declared “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.” Biden later declared that he would make O’Rourke a type of “gun czar” for his Administration. Such “hell yes” moments are likely to continue with the approaching 2022 election, but they may meet more judges who say “hell no” in constitutional challenges. Considering there was pro-Second Amendment black nationalists calling for the death of the white race, it isn’t how the reverse stance is taken by NPR regarding the Second Amendment and racism.",0,1
"Karma? Mark Zuckerberg Blasts Whistleblowers Who Expose Facebook’s ‘Censorship’ — in Leaked Video The news comes almost two weeks after two insiders revealed Facebook has allegedly been testing an algorithm on its users that demoted, buried, and hid comments, describing “potentially or actually true” events or facts. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has criticised company employees who expose the social media giant’s “alleged” censorship programme. Ironically, he made the remarks during a video chat, later leaked by a Facebook insider. The video was subsequently posted online by a non-profit investigative media outlet, Project Veritas. During the conversation with high-ranking Facebook officials, Zuckerberg stressed that the tech giant should be good “at rooting out people, who are leaking stuff”, lamenting that the company had suffered from numerous whistleblowers last year. “I’ve been clear that we have a number of efforts to find people and we terminate people and pursue the recourse that we have when we identify them”, Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg’s view on whistleblowers was echoed by Heidi Swartz, Deputy General Counsel of Employment Law & Investigations, who emphasised that all leaks – good or bad – are damaging to the company. “They’re not the right way to bring about change, especially in a company like this where people are free to share their opinion. You may think you’re leaking because you want to hold leadership accountable or that you’re on the right side of history, but that is very subjective and you may not have all the information to make that call”, Swartz said. Zuck really doesn’t get it does he? He can fire Morgan Kahmann, but more heroes will continue to step up.

According to the documents shared with Project Veritas, Facebook essentially censored comments of users, who spoke of concerns about coronavirus vaccines. The social media giant wants to “drastically reduce user exposure” to vaccine hesitancy comments. Health experts and entrepreneurs have repeatedly drawn attention to the misinformation surrounding the coronavirus pandemic and vaccines, which they say may hamper the global fight against the infectious disease that according to Johns Hopkins University has already left 3.7 million dead. Yet, per the documents shared by the insiders, in its crusade against vaccine hesitancy Facebook was ready to censor comments that described “potentially or actually true events, or facts that can raise safety concerns”. Commenting on the exposure, Facebook said the company has informed users about its policy. “We proactively announced this policy on our company blog and also updated our help centre with this information”, said a spokesperson. One of the insiders, Morgan Kahmann, says otherwise. Speaking recently on the Fox show “Tucker Carlson Tonight” he said he believes Facebook’s actions are “highly immoral”. “The users at Facebook are not aware that this is going on and if you’re using Facebook or a social platform and they’re censoring the content of your comments unbeknownst to you”, he said. Kahmann, a whistleblower who leaked internal documents exposing “vaccine hesitancy”, revealed that he was fired by Facebook for “violating the company’s policy”. He said he was escorted to his car by managers, who collected his equipment.

"G7 Finance Ministers Reach ‘Historic Agreement’ on Biden’s Push for Global Minimum Corporate Tax of 15% Finance ministers from the Group of Seven nations have backed the Biden administration’s plans to set a global minimum tax of 15% on corporate earnings. Outside the G7, the plan has faced opposition from tax havens like Ireland. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met with her counterparts from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom in London on Saturday, where she made her administration’s case for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. The ministers agreed to back her proposal, with UK finance minister Rishi Sunak announcing the deal shortly after the meeting. “G7 finance ministers… after years of discussions, have reached a historic agreement to reform the global tax system to make it fit for the global digital age and, crucially, to make sure that it’s fair so that the right companies pay the right tax in the right places,” Sunak said in a video posted to Twitter. 🚨 At the @G7 in London today, my finance counterparts and I have come to a historic agreement on global tax reform requiring the largest multinational tech giants to pay their fair share of tax in the UK.👇The thread below explains exactly what this means. #G7UK pic.twitter.com/HdcK1HuM91— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) June 5, 2021 Once implemented, the plan will make it more difficult for corporations to set up operations abroad, where tax rates are often dramatically lower. The US, for example, charges a flat corporate tax rate of 21%, which President Joe Biden has proposed – against Republican outcry – hiking to 28%. A US multinational seeking to avoid this rate can simply locate in a country like Ireland, where they pay only 12.5%, one of the lowest rates in Europe. All of the G7 nations already tax corporations at or above the proposed 15% rate, meaning smaller nations will be pressured to hike their rates if Biden’s plan is implemented. Ireland has already thrown cold water on the Biden administration’s plan. Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told Sky News last month that his government has “significant reservations” about introducing a global minimum rate, claiming that such a move “means only certain countries, and certain size economies can benefit from that base.” Donohue, as current President of the Eurogroup, attended Saturday’s meeting, but the other ministers’ agreement doesn’t put Ireland’s low rate in jeopardy yet. The measures agreed on Saturday will need to find broader agreement at a meeting of the G20, set for next month in Venice, Italy. Though it has occasionally faced opposition at home, Ireland’s low rate has attracted foreign firms to the country since the early 1990s, with the influx of foreign investment one of the key drivers in the rapid economic growth that followed. However, proponents of a global minimum regime insist that hikes are needed to offset government spending, which ballooned across the developed world in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement last month, Yellen said that a “global race to the bottom” on corporate tax has undermined “the United States’ and other countries’ ability to raise the revenue needed to make critical investments” – such as the record-breaking federal budget proposed by Biden last week.

"Muslim Neighborhoods in British Towns are ‘No-Go Areas’ for White People, New Book Claims An academic who studied Muslim integration in Britain has revealed in a new book that women and children in some communities are subjected to Taliban-like rules, and non-Muslims face threats of violence. Ed Husain, professor at the Walsh School of Foreign Service in Georgetown University, visited mosques across Britain, speaking to businesses owners, imams and locals about life in predominantly Muslim neighbourhoods. He used his on-the-ground research to write a book, ‘Among The Mosques: A Journey Across Muslim Britain’, which is set for release next week. The Muslim author grew up in a Bangladeshi family in London and was radicalised in his youth before renouncing extremism. According to the professor, integration issues in the UK continue to persist. One man in Blackburn told Husain that “Asian” teengers repeatedly “jumped” his 12-year-old son simply for “being white.” Another local told the author that certain parts of the town had become “no-go areas.” Blackburn has the largest Muslim population in the UK outside of London, and is a major hub for ultra-orthodox Islamic sects. Husain also learned that one school in the town had barred girls from participating in swimming lessons, saying that it was inappropriate for them to be seen in bathing costumes. While visiting a bookstore in Blackburn, the author stumbled across several volumes advocating strict restrictions and dress codes for women, as well as copies of a book which argued that it is sinful to enjoy dancing and listening to music. The town also reportedly has restaurants that provide gender separation for their clientele. While visiting Bradford, Husain was amazed by how few white residents there were, and was reportedly told by a taxi driver that they had “gone with the wind.” He noted that mosques were on nearly every corner and that even private homes served as places of worship and religious schools. The professor also learned that some Muslim parents in the area had prohibited their children from going to drawing and dance lessons. An imam in the city confided that there was “widespread abuse of disabled children in the Muslim community,” and that parents were pocketing social welfare money while neglecting their children. In Didsbury, the author came across a sign for a local ‘Sharia Department’, which deals with marital issues and other disputes through the lens of Islamic law. He reported similar interactions and situations in places like Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. One woman told him that some Muslim communities in the UK had become a “different universe” from the rest of the country. Like other European countries, the UK has struggled with integrating immigrants from Muslim-majority nations, sparking concern about radicalisation. At the same time, reports suggest that there is a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment in the country. During Husain’s trip to Bradford, a local predicted that anti-Muslim sentiment could lead to “an apartheid city” within 30 years and give rise to Nazi-like political parties that would persecute immigrants.",0,1
"World Economic Forum Pushes MIT Program that Automatically Detects “Disinformation Narratives” Online Misinformation and propaganda are as old and as present as human communication and societies organized into states. The curiously intense focus on these the last couple of years prompts many to believe such issues are now used as justification and smokescreen for suppressing legitimate but unwanted speech, and free expression-related civil rights. Depending on where you stand on that, you may be reassured or dismayed that the World Economic Forum (WEF) is one of the entities pushing hard the agenda of online misinformation presenting a huge danger today – and endorsing some “solutions.” One comes from MIT and its “Reconnaissance of Influence Operations (RIO)” – now there’s a name George Orwell would probably not kick out of his novels. Out the gate, RIO “establishes” that power of misinformation on social networks and elsewhere online is such as to sway elections, but also allow different points of view to be expressed, or as the program announcement put it, “sow discord.” Another dangerous point the MIT program aims to address is disinformation feeding “conspiracy theories” – but in light of the recent embarrassing U-turn on the “Wuhan lab leak” there’s no evidence of a firm and consensus-based definition of what a “conspiracy” even is. Rather, the category seems prone to political whim. But RIO looks to be designed to work under the false premise that these definitions are objective, and agreed on by all stakeholders. You’d think that as far as conspiracies go, the one about Russians electing a US president by exploiting social media is the most tired and by now well-debunked one. Nevertheless, that is one of the claims to fame made by those behind RIO and MIT Lincoln Laboratory’s Artificial Intelligence Software Architectures and Algorithms Group, whose goal is not only to “automatically” detect what they deem to be disinformation, but also what their machine learning algorithms are programed to identify as “disinformation narratives.” That means the tool would recognize the level of influence of accounts not only by their size in terms of followers, but also other elements as a measure of overall impact. Recognize for what reason? Highly likely to censor and remove. “The team envisions RIO being used by both government and industry as well as beyond social media and in the realm of traditional media such as newspapers and television,” the WEF said on its website.",0,1

"AOC Rejects $100,000 Raised By Conservatives Trying To Help Out Her ‘Abuela’ Far-left Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) rejected a conservative fundraising effort to help her grandmother in fix up her home damaged by a hurricane. The episode began Wednesday when Ocasio-Cortez claimed on Twitter that she visited her sick grandmother in Puerto Rico, whose home had appeared to suffer some interior damage from Hurricane Maria in 2017. Just over a week ago, my abuela fell ill. I went to Puerto Rico to see her- my 1st time in a year+ bc of COVID.This is her home. Hurricane María relief hasn’t arrived. Trump blocked relief $ for PR.People are being forced to flee ancestral homes, & developers are taking them. pic.twitter.com/wnRxLalA2D— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) June 2, 2021 The Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh weighed in, calling out AOC as a bad granddaughter for failing to help her “abuela” while at the same time “living in luxury.” “Shameful that you live in luxury while allowing your own grandmother to suffer in these squalid conditions,” he told the New York congresswoman on Twitter. AOC responded by accusing Walsh of perpetuating systemic racism in permitting Puerto Rico to remain a U.S. colony. You don’t even have a concept for the role that 1st-gen, first-born daughters play in their families.My abuela is okay. But instead of only caring for mine & letting others suffer, I’m calling attention to the systemic injustices you seem totally fine w/ in having a US colony. https://t.co/QN0ZVoyDt2— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) June 2, 2021 That’s when Walsh launched a GoFundMe to raise money for AOC’s grandmother in attempt to mock her hypocrisy, raising over $100,000 in less than 24 hours. From Walsh’s GoFundMe page: “On June 2nd, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez reported to Twitter that her dear abuela has fallen ill and continues to live in squalid conditions since her home was ravaged by Hurricane María. One cannot be certain of the cost to repair grandma’s house, but surely most of the work could be completed for the price of AOC’s shiny Tesla Model 3. As AOC pointed out to us, we “don’t even have a concept for the role that [incredibly successful children of two American citizens…] play in their families,” but clearly caring for their own grandparent isn’t part of it. Says the congresswoman, “…instead of only caring for [my own grandmother] & letting others suffer, I’m calling attention to the systemic injustices…” No, seriously. She really said that. Sadly, virtue-signaling isn’t going to fix abuela’s roof. So we are. Let’s all kick in to help save AOC’s abuela’s ancestral home. Any amount is appreciated, but the cost of a monthly lease payment on that Tesla is around $499…All proceeds will be donated to abuela, if she will accept them. Walsh reported on Saturday that “someone” in AOC’s family told GoFundMe that they won’t accept the money he raised. “UPDATE: ‘someone’ in AOC’s abuela’s family told GoFundMe that she won’t take the money, even though AOC previously claimed that her grandma was in dire straits (and it was Trump’s fault). @AOC still hasn’t acknowledged this effort or thanked us,” Walsh wrote.

AOC appears to be so engrossed in partisan politics that she’s not even willing to even help her own grandmother with money that was raised by conservatives. However, it’s not surprising, and conservatives should know better than to think they can score points with these kind of ploys. “It’s pretty fascinating, really. We raised enough to change her grandmother’s life. We could have raised enough to lift her whole neighborhood out of poverty. AOC shut it down. She’d rather leave people to suffer than accept help from us. Very revealing episode,” Walsh noted.

I’ll leave you to the critique of that, Brian,” she added. How nauseating. Others on social media came to the same conclusion, noting that the media would never ask President Trump’s press secretary such a softball question, even when they were factually wrong most of the time during his term.

"Ted Cruz: Fauci Emails Show Facebook Operating as Extension of Government — Now Exposed To Legal Liability Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said that Dr. Anthony Fauci’s emails show Facebook played a major role in suppressing critical COVID-19 information on behalf of the federal government. During an interview on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures”, Cruz explained that, according to Fauci’s emails, Facebook acted as an agent of the government and so is now open to legal liability. “In the email dump that came out, it makes clear that this is not just being sloppy. It is systematic and it is systematically an effort to mislead the American people,” Cruz told host Maria Bartiromo. “And as you noted he wasn’t doing it alone but was doing it with much of the US government behind him and with Facebook and Big Tech operating as an extension of the US government in order to silence any views that disagreed, not with the science, because he wasn’t looking for the science. He was suppressing the science,” he continued. “…If you went out and posted the facts that led, a year ago, to the very strong likelihood that the coronavirus escaped from a Chinese government lab in Wuhan, China. If you posted that a year ago and they took it down, I think there is a very good argument you have a cause of action against Facebook.” Cruz explained how the emails reveal that Facebook acted as an agent for the government as the coronavirus pandemic unfolded, peaked, and then receded. “And Facebook would ordinarily say, ‘We’re a private company. We’re not liable.'” Cruz said. “Well, you know, when they act at the behest of the government, when they contact Fauci, when they say, ‘Should we censor this?’ and Fauci says, ‘Yes’, and they censor it for the federal government, and then magically when the government changes its mind and says, ‘Oh, all those facts that were there a year ago, now you’re allowed to talk about it’ — they stop censoring it with the flip of a switch.” “That lays a very strong argument that Facebook is operating as a state agency and that opens very serious legal liability,” Cruz added. The doctor who thanked Dr. Fauci for dismissing the Wuhan lab leak theory is the same guy who gave $600k to the lab, “investigated” it for the WHO and then acted as a Facebook fact-checker censoring info on the Wuhan lab leak theory.",0,0

"Stanford Epidemiologist: Fauci’s ‘Credibility Is Entirely Shot’ A Stanford epidemiologist called out Dr. Anthony Fauci for flip-flopping on numerous issues from the beginning of the global coronavirus pandemic. “I think his credibility is entirely shot,” Professor Jay Bhattacharya told Fox News’ “The Ingraham Angle” on Friday. Are Fauci's days numbered? pic.twitter.com/UiH46emz22— Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) June 5, 2021 “In the early days of the epidemic, he was quite a sensible person,” Bhattacharya said. “He understood immunity, he understood the necessity of not panicking the population. Something happened in late February where he just flipped on a dime.” “It wasn’t the science changing. Something else happened where he just changed,” he noted. Bhattacharya also criticized Fauci for making the “rookie mistake” of overestimating the COVID fatality rate. “He made a rookie mistake that no epidemiologist should make,” Bhattacharya said. “He conflated the case mortality rate with the infection mortality rate. There’s many, many times more people with infections of COVID than were caught, especially back then.” “It’s just an enormous mistake,” Bhattacharya continued. “And I think it’s really unfortunate that we have this person who just didn’t really have the expertise to lead the response, and yet we somehow we venerated him.” Fauci’s mask guidance is another example of his flip-flopping based on political, not scientific, factors. “Yes, you should change your mind when the science changes,” he concluded. “What is that science that changed that convinced him that masks are the most effective way?” Roger Stone joins The Bollingers on the War Room to ask, “Why have no Deep State agents been indicted?”",0,0
"Trump: ‘China Must Pay’ Reparations For Unleashing Coronavirus Pandemic President Donald Trump issued a strong message against China during his speech in North Carolina on Saturday, stating the country is directly responsible for the COVID pandemic. “We should all declare with one unified voice that China must pay. They must pay,” Trump said to the cheering crowd of Republicans. Trump called for China to pay the world $10 trillion to compensate for the economic devastation and wipe out any debts other countries may owe. “All nations should work together to present China a bill for a minimum of $10 trillion to compensate for the damage,” Trump said. “As a first step, all countries should collectively cancel any debt they owe to China as a down payment on reparations.” “The nations of the world should no longer owe money to China,” he added. Trump also called for a “firm 100 percent tariff on all goods made in China”, but added that Joe Biden would never allow that to happen to his benefactor. “I don’t think they want to keep Biden happy. I don’t think they care too much about Biden, to be honest,” he said. The former president also took a victory lap for correctly claiming that COVID-19 originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. “The media, the Democrats, and the so-called experts are now finally admitting what I first said 13 months ago: The evidence demonstrates that the virus originated in a Chinese government lab,” Trump said.

"Fauci’s NIH Funded Wuhan Military Scientist Who Died Mysteriously After Filing COVID Vaccine Patent As we move further down the rabbit hole of exactly what in the devil has been going on in China’s ‘bat labs,’ we now turn our attention to one Zhou Yusen – a Chinese military scientist specializing in coronaviruseswho collaborated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s “Bat Woman,” Zhengli Shi – with at least one project to geneticially manipulate coronaviruses having been funded by three grants from the National Institutes of Heath (NIH) – home to Dr. Anthony Fauci – via US universities, according to documents obtained by The Weekend Australian (ostensibly leaked by Aussie intelligence). The previously undisclosed NIH funding of a PLA military scientist is separate from millions in grants awarded EcoHealth alliance, which also collaborated with the WIV. The revelation shows American money was funding risky ­research on coronaviruses with People’s Liberation Army scientists – including decorated military scientist Zhou Yusen and the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s “Bat Woman”, Shi Zhengli. Now we learn that Zhou, 54, is dead – three months after filing a patent for a COVID-19 vaccine in Feb. 2020. According to the report, Zhou’s May 2020 death went largely under the radar, despite the fact that he was an award-winning scientist at the PLA’s Laboratory of Infection and Immunity at the Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology. “There were no reports paying tribute to his life. His death was only mentioned in passing in a Chinese-media report in July and at the end of a December scientific paper. Both had the word ­“deceased” in brackets after his name.” And while Zhou’s death may have been suspicious (or he may have simply died of COVID), the revelation that the US government was funding his research with the WIV may provide a clue as to why US officials – Dr. Fauci (backed by the ‘scientific community’ after his lapdog, EcoHelath Alliance’s Peter Daszak, penned a ‘natural origin or you’re a lunatic‘ letter in the Lancet) – peddled the CCP’s ‘natural origin’ theory, while any suggestion that it could have been created in and/or leaked from the very lab which received NIH dollars was strictly verboten. Emails released under a Freedom of Information request from Buzzfeed this week showed that, in the early days of the pandemic, Dr Fauci was concerned that US funding had gone towards gain-of-function research in China.In other emails, scientists wrote to Dr Fauci expressing the preliminary view that the SARS-CoV-2 genome appeared “inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory” and that it had some features that “potentially look engineered”. -The Weekend Australian In short, ‘conflict of interest’ doesn’t even begin to explain what Fauci is now going to have to explain the next time Rand Paul has him in the hot seat. The revelation shows American money was funding risky ­research on coronaviruses with People’s Liberation Army scientists – including decorated military scientist Zhou Yusen and the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s “Bat Woman”, Shi Zhengli.…National security sources said the ties between Zhou and Dr Shi ­supported claims by US intelligence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was engaged in “secret military activity.” -The Australian How long was China sitting on the genetic sequence for SARS-CoV-2? If we’re considering the timeline and its implications, Zhou died three months after filing a Feb. 24, 2020 patent application for a COVID-19 vaccine. While this could mean that he was working on a COVID-19 vaccine before the virus became public knowledge in December 2019, keep in mind that Moderna was able to design the sequence for their COVID-19 vaccine just two days after Chinese officials released its genetic sequence on Jan. 11, 2020 – filing for their first related patent in March, two months later. Also note that Zhou had been working on coronavirus vaccines since at least 2006 in response the original SARS-CoV outbreak – authoring a study which found that “the vaccines containing the (receptor-binding domain) of SARS-CoV S protein may induce sufficient neutralising antibodies and long-term ­protective immunity against SARS-CoV challenge in the ­established mouse model.” So, assuming an expert would need approximately two months to go from genomic sequence to patent application, it implies that China withheld the genetic sequence for a month before its Jan. 11 public release. Or, Zhou may have had more of a ‘head start’ than that. “This is something we have never seen achieved before, raising the question of whether this work may have started much ­earlier,” said Nikolai Petrovsky from Flinders University. (And if one wants to explore the implications assuming SARS-CoV-2 was genetically engineered, Karl Denninger has some thoughts below) And while we may never know the full extent of Zhou’s role in all of this, he and ‘bat woman’ Zhengli were working on a COVID vaccine right before the pandemic. Per the Weekend Australian: Right before the pandemic, Zhou and three other scientists from the PLA-run Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology – Yuehong Chen, Lei He and Shishui Sun – partnered with two Wuhan Institute of Virology scientists – Dr Shi and Jing Chen – and eight Chinese scientists now based in the US at the University of Minnesota and the Lindsley Kimball Research Institute, New York Blood Centre. Their paper, titled Molecular Mechanism for Antibody-­Dependent Enhancement of Coronavirus Entry, was submitted to the Journal of Virology on November 27, 2019, and was published on February 14, 2020. The research examined MERS and SARS coronaviruses as avenues for antibody-based ­antiviral drug therapy to treat coronaviruses.Their paper had some positive results: “Taken together, our ­results show that RBD-specific neutralising MAbs bind to the same region on coronavirus spikes as viral receptors do, trigger conformational changes of the spikes as viral receptors do, and mediate ADE through the same pathways as viral-receptor-dependent viral entry.”They found this “novel molecular mechanism for antibody-enhanced viral entry” could “guide future vaccination and ­antiviral strategies”.This study was conducted “in vitro”, meaning in a petri dish or test tube, using humanised kidney and lung cells. Their last paragraph indicated the next step in a future paper would be to conduct “in vivo” experiments with ­humanised mice or primates. A paper published in Nature ­Reviews Immunology 18 months later, in April this year, would find that “neutralising monoclonal antibodies” could help the treatment of Covid-19. Meanwhile, Zhou’s patent application states: “The invention ­relates to the field of biomedicine, and relates to a Covid-19 ­vaccine, preparation methods and applications. The fusion ­protein provided by the invention can be used to develop the Covid-19 protein vaccine and a drug for preventing or treating the Covid-19.” Yusen Zhou (周育森) (‡) 1.

The NIH-PLA Network：left to right = infiltration pathway pic.twitter.com/M5E14ylSM9— 德意志之鹰 (@dezying) June 4, 2021 What does this all mean now? Karl Denninger has a few thoughts via market-ticker.org, and is notably very suspicious of the patent timing (edited for brevity): So what do we now know? China’s militarywas in fact involved at the Wuhan lab. It was not just a civilian operation. This, by the way, has been repeatedly denied over the last year and change.The lab’s scientists knew not only the sequencing of the virus but in addition had a patentable way to create an alleged vaccine before the pandemic was public. It takes time to draft patents and figure them out. Quite a lot of time, in fact — not a couple weeks or months. It takes time to prove up patent material, including in the case of a vaccine. To patent something you must be able to demonstrate it; you cannot patent ideas, only embodiments of ideas. In that case you would have to prove immunogenicity which isn’t instantaneous; it takes weeks or even months to get through original science on this with animals and then humans, which means the date of knowledge was not February 24th it was months or even further before that.That means they were working on this even before that time because to work on a vaccine you have to know you must or would want to work on it in the first place. This in turn means they knew damn well there was a virulent virus in the wild prior to that date, or they released it or intended to release it into the wild on purpose. Nobody comes up with a vaccine for a virus you intend to and have confined entirely within a laboratory in animal or cell culture testing; that’s worthless. Without an isolate to create a vaccine for and a virus outside of a lab environment where vaccination becomes a “thing” that might be required and thus have value why would you do the work to create one? What’s the timeline on all this? Many, many months or even a couple of years. That means either the virus was “out” for many months to a couple of years before February of 2020 (not a month or two) or the Chinese intended to release it in the fall of 2019. In either case the evidence is now overwhelming that this was not a virus that “magically appeared” one fine day in late December having come naturally from bats and perhaps pangolins. That is not just improbable anymore — it is now, on the manifest weight of the evidence, impossible. … Next up is exactly what sort of vaccine patent we’re talking about here? Specifically how is it that the “stiffened” areas in the viral vector and mRNA shots we’re using in the US came to be known and proved up? How did Moderna and Pfizer know they needed to do that? That sort of study takes months if not years too, not days or weeks, to both come up with it and then prove it actually works as expected. Remember that Covid-19 has a rather-unique site on the spike called the “furin-cleavage” area which it uses to “fold” and get into the cell; the S1 unit attaches, the cleavage area “folds” and then the second part penetrates the cell wall like a spear. SARS and MERS both lack this structure so there was no “prior art” to use and in the first couple of months the characterizing of all of this was pretty darn new. Yet the “official story” is that these folks had a proposed candidate configuration, including the replacement of encodings to “stiffen” that area within days of the publication of the viral RNA sequence for Covid-19. Is the completed work in that area what the Chinese “gave” us complete with that part of the work already done? That would explain how it happened that quickly, wouldn’t it? I’d sure like to understand how someone — anyone — does that sort of work complete with the lab verification in cell cultures and animals, reachig those conclusions in days. What are the connections there? I’d like a full explanation of that please. * * * As would we.

"‘No Trust’: Top Republican Kevin McCarthy Calls for Fauci’s Resignation Amid COVID-19 Email Leak Dr Fauci has previously rejected the idea of his National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases possibly sharing responsibility for the COVID-19 pandemic. US Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has become the latest GOP lawmaker to call out Dr Anthony Fauci, the chief medical adviser to the US president. Asked if the US top COVID-19 doctor should resign or be fired from his role as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, McCarthy said “yeah, because you do not have the trust in him”. “The American people don’t have trust in Dr Fauci. Let’s find a person we can trust. Take politics aside, I mean we’re talking about American lives here”, McCarthy said on the Breitbart News Saturday radio show. Dr Anthony Fauci has recently been facing calls from Republican lawmakers to be fired. On Saturday, Republican House Representative Matt Gaetz claimed in an interview that Dr Fauci “has blood on his hands”, and days earlier two top House Republicans said it was “imperative” for Fauci, to testify before congressional committees and provide information related to the origins of COVID-19. The US COVID-19 tsar has faced increasing criticism lately over a $600,000 grant that went to the EcoHealth Alliance and ended up at the Wuhan lab in China, from which, according to growing speculation, the disease could have escaped. The criticism of Dr Fauci has also been fuelled by the recent release by BuzzFeed of 3,200 pages of the chief medical adviser’s emails dating back to the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. In one of the alleged emails, Peter Daszak, head of the EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit organisation with ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, reportedly thanked Fauci for downplaying the possibility that COVID-19 had escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Fauci, however, recently said that the revelations in those papers, suggesting he was warned at the very outset of the pandemic that COVID-19 might have been “engineered”, had been “taken out of context”. In March, the World Health Organisation released the full version of its report on the origins of the coronavirus, in which the WHO called a leak of COVID-19 from a laboratory very unlikely. The report also suggested that the virus was most likely transmitted to humans from bats via another animal. Recently, however, US President Joe Biden ordered members of the US intelligence community to produce a report in 90 days to put an end to the debate over whether the coronavirus had spread to humans from animals naturally or if it leaked from a laboratory in China, promising to release the report in full. Hours after Biden’s statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said that the agency did not know the exact origins of the coronavirus at the time. The speculation that COVID-19 could be man-made has been circulating for more than a year, with the former Donald Trump administration repeatedly claiming the disease may have originated in the Wuhan lab. The president himself referred to COVID-19 as the “China virus”, while Beijing consistently rejected the allegations.

They don’t have people like we do who go off on their own and do what they have to do,” Trump said. As rumors swirl around his political future, Trump alarmed critics on Friday when he said in an interview that he may be interested in running for Congress in the near future. Speaking with right-wing radio host Wayne Allyn Root, it was suggested that Trump should become House Speaker, which the former president admitted was a “very interesting” proposition. “People have said, run for the Senate, OK?” Trump said following the suggestion. “But you know, your idea might be better.” Roger Stone joins The Alex Jones Show to break down the Leftist political witch hunt as he predicts a criminal indictment for Trump.",0,0
"Cyber Polygon: Will The Next Globalist War Game Lead To Another Convenient Catastrophe? Back in April I published an article titled ‘Globalists Will Need Another Crisis In America As Their Reset Agenda Fails’. In it I noted an odd trend which many of us in the liberty media have become aware of over the years – Almost every major man-made catastrophe in the US and in many other parts of the world in the past couple decades has been preceded by a government or globalist “exercise”. These exercises and war games tend to mimic the exact disaster that would eventually strike the public only days or weeks later. Sometimes the mock disaster exercises and the real events happen at the same time. The covid pandemic was no exception. It’s quite miraculous… I have specifically outlined the bizarre “coincidence” of the World Economic Forum’s Event 201 exercise, a war game co-funded by Bill Gates and Johns Hopkins and launched in October of 2019. Event 201 simulated a global novel zoonotic coronavirus pandemic (supposedly spread from bats to people) that “required” a global lockdown response. Only two months later the real thing actually happened. Almost every aspect of the Covid event has played out exactly as was practiced during the WEF war game. One very disturbing element of the covid response has been the coordinated suppression campaign by Big Tech platforms from YouTube to Facebook and Twitter. This campaign has sought to undermine or destroy any facts, data and opinions which run contrary to the government narrative on covid, even if the official narrative on covid ends up being completely wrong. The strategy was described in detail during Event 201 and it was executed with extreme efficiency among supposedly disconnected companies and governments around the world. It’s almost as if they KNEW a coronavirus pandemic was about to happen, and they were already staged to control the public reaction well in advance. And let’s be clear because I do not want to seem ambiguous; the World Economic Forum and their globalist partners have been the prime beneficiaries during the pandemic. As WEF head Klaus Schwab has excitedly noted over and over again, the pandemic is a perfect “opportunity” for globalists to fast track what they call the “Great Reset” agenda – A plan to completely dismantle the current political and economic framework of the world and rebuild it into a highly centralized socialist civilization in which they are in complete control and personal freedom is a faded memory. This is why recent revelations of Covid’s probable lab origins are not at all surprising. Just mentioning this idea a year ago in social media was enough to get you banned. And, if you want to know where to find the truth, always look first to the subjects you are not allowed to discuss. As I stated in my article ‘How Viral Pandemic Benefits The Globalist Agenda’, published in January of 2020 at the very beginning of the outbreak: “I have a hard time ignoring the strange “coincidence” of the high level biohazard labs in Wuhan in favor of the idea that the virus was launched by chance due to the odd diets of central Chinese people. Given the evidence it appears that the coronavirus was gestated in a lab, not in someone’s bat and snake soup. In 2017, scientists outside of China warned that these labs were not secure and that a virus might escape one of the facilities…..I would use the term “escape” loosely, as there is a possibility that this event was created intentionally…” Elites like Dr. Anthony Fauci (a close associate of Bill Gates and Bill Gates SR.) directly funded studies at the Wuhan Lab through the NIAID since 2015, and specifically funded the study of the infectious transfer of coronaviruses from bats to other mammals including humans. And yes, the NIAID was in fact involved in “gain of function” experiments using SARS and coronavirus variants at this time, despite Anthony Fauci claiming otherwise. The National Institute Of Health’s own website confirms this. All of these facts support the argument that covid is a lab created bioweapon, and in my view according to the evidence so far it was released deliberately in close alliance with the Chinese government. Fauci even somehow “predicted” in 2017 that Donald Trump would face a “surprise infectious disease outbreak” during his presidency, stating that “We will definitely get surprised in the next few years…” The scheme has certainly worked to an extent. In large portions of Europe, Asia and Australia the WEF is getting what it always wanted. That said, some things did not go as planned. For example, Event 201 predicted an initial 65 million people dead within the first year of the pandemic; this did not happen, and it was not because governments saved any lives. In fact, government lockdowns and restrictions did nothing to stave off the spread of covid and independent studies have proven mask mandates to be completely ineffective in stopping the virus. The reason for the comparatively small body count is the fact that Covid’s death rate is only 0.26% among otherwise healthy people. The only place wear covid is a true threat is in nursing homes among elderly people with preexisting conditions. Because of the miscalculations of the elites, the reset agenda appears to be failing in some parts of the world. In the US, resistance to the lockdowns as well as the experimental vaccines has grown exponentially to the point that dozens of states are now passing laws which prohibit enforcement of covid restrictions and “medical passports”. The alternative media has also proven resilient against censorship and information suppression, and we have been proven to be right time and time again. We were the first people to warn that the death rate of covid was being exaggerated (the WHO and other establishment institutions predicted a death rate of at least 3%, FAR above the reality). We were the first people to warn that the lockdowns and mask rules did nothing to stop the spread (states that removed restrictions ended up with FALLING infections and deaths). And, we were the first people to warn that the virus was behaving more like a bioweapon, and that its origin was more likely the Level 4 lab in Wuhan, China, right down the street from the animal market that the Chinese government originally claimed was the source of the outbreak. We were also the first people to warn that the pandemic would be used as a rationale for the enforcement of vaccine passports, which would create a two tear society designed to force people who do not want to take the mRNA vaccines into compliance. We have been proven right once again as the state of Oregon has become the first in the US to demand proof of vaccination (a passport) before residents are able to enter any businesses or establishments. We have consistently been called “conspiracy theorists” throughout this event by government bureaucrats and the media. But, we were were right about almost everything, and the mainstream media has been wrong about almost everything. Either that, or they have been knowingly lying about almost everything. This dynamic is important to understand because I believe the situation is far from over and that more crisis events are about to be engineered (or they will magically happen by coincidence). My biggest concern right now is the upcoming ‘Cyberpolygon’ exercise being headed by the WEF this July. The war game is meant to “simulate” a cyberattack on vital infrastructure that would lead to a shutdown of the global supply chain, or at least the supply chains within certain nations. As I warned in April, the timing of Cyberpolygon is suspicious. As the covid lockdown agenda is breaking down in the US and the vaccine passports are not winning favor among a large percentage of Americans, the globalists will need another crisis even if they hope to achieve their goals for their Great Reset. Only weeks after I published my initial concerns about Cyberpolygon, a massive cyberattack was reported which struck the 5,500 mile Colonial Pipeline. The pipeline supplies gasoline to most of the eastern seaboard and after a week of being shut down numerous states were reporting gas shortages. The story has since quietly faded from mainstream news cycles. In the past few days, yet another major cyberattack has been reported against JBS, a meat company that supplies around 23% of all US beef and pork. Production at JBS has shut down, and now there is the possibility of meat shortages across the country if the problems are not solved soon. Again, is it just coincidence that these large scale cyberattacks are happening with greater frequency in the lead-up to a WEF’s Cyberpolygon simulation? Or, is Cyberpolygon another Event 201? Is it a beta test for a disaster that is planned for the near future? The WEF is openly comparing future cyber attacks to covid outbreaks, so I’m inclined to suspect the latter. The supply chain issue has come to the forefront in the wake of the pandemic as retailers have had to deal with intermittent shortages, and manufacturers are facing a lack of components. Not only that, but inflationary troubles are also weighing on supplies. That said, a cyberattack is another animal entirely; whether or not the event is real or staged, the supply chain is fragile because of global interdependency. In the US, there are many necessities that rely on foreign manufacturers or the “just in time” freight system. Preparedness and long term storage are not a part of the vocabulary of the common US business. I don’t really know if the supply chain could be shut down completely using a cyberattack, but in combination with inflation and draconian pandemic restrictions, it is possible to disrupt the flow of goods for weeks at a time. It is also impossible to predict how many people are prepared for such a calamity. My hope is that more than 30% of Americans have at least begun the path to prepping, but undoubtedly a majority of the country has not. All it would take is a couple weeks of shortages or a grid down scenario and most people would be facing starvation, among other things. If Event 201 is any indication, then we should remain vigilant and watch carefully for another major cyberattack affecting the supply chain within two months of the WEF’s Cyberpolygon exercise in July.

"Scientist Who Told Fauci COVID ‘Potentially Engineered’ Deletes Twitter Account A leading virologist who emailed Dr Fauci in January 2020 to tell him that the COVID-19 virus looked like it had been engineered in a lab has gone dark on Twitter, after deleting thousands of posts, then terminating his entire account completely. Dr Kristian Andersen of the Scripps Research Institute recently hit headlines after his comments were highlighted in the FOIA released Fauci emails: At the very minimum, this shows lab leak (or worse) was taken exceedingly seriously and was never a “conspiracy theory.”At the maximum, it opens up questions of an unprecedented global cover up.Either way establishment politicians and corporate media look worse than ever. pic.twitter.com/R4UOA5M3gg— Raheem J. Kassam (@RaheemKassam) June 2, 2021 Andersen’s comments prompted Fauci to order his deputy Hugh Auchincloss to expect a call from the former to discuss the matter. Fauci attached a paper to the email concerning previous ‘gain of function’ research and wrote “Read this paper as well as the email that I will forward. You will have tasks today that must be done.” Annnnd here come the smoking guns. Feb 1, 2020 Fauci exchanged emails with Hugh Auchincloss – a big cheese at the NIAIDI'm still trying to thread through these but here are a series of emails with email subject line: ""IMPORTANT""The real subject: gain of function research. pic.twitter.com/5TIfrp9sSZ— Justin Hart (@justin_hart) June 2, 2021 Just two months after suggesting that the virus was “inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory,” Dr Andersen published a paper throwing his full weight behind the ‘natural origin’ theory. The scientist then received a CREID grant totalling almost $2 million from Fauci’s NIH, at the same time that Dr. Peter Daszak, President of the EcoHealth Alliance, the organisation that was intimately involved with the gain of function studies in Wuhan, received the same funding. 2 months later he reverses course and publishes his ""Proximal Origin"" paper, helping shield NIH/NIAID from potential probes into its GOF funding.5 months after that, he gets $1.88 million in CREID funding, along with Daszak who gets $1.54 million more.https://t.co/PFPIMxZd7o pic.twitter.com/7JmapgRNTm— Radical Centrist, wrathful tantric deity (@RadCentrism) June 2, 2021 In the wake of the email reveal, the scientist was under bombardment to explain his initial findings.

"Malaysian Police Use Heat Drones to Check Temperatures From Above Malaysian police are using drones which can check temperatures from as high as 20 meters above ground in the latest example of coronavirus population control. The drones alert authorities if someone has a high temperature reading by emitting a red light, according to Bernama, Malaysia’s state news agency. “Malaysian police have previously warned they will use drones to enforce earlier travel restrictions, with officers in some areas also stating they would carry out surprise home visits to ensure people were following rules,” reports the Guardian. There have been numerous previous examples of authorities deploying surveillance drone technology to enforce COVID-19 rules. Authorities in Spain have used surveillance drones to make sure people who visit beaches are complying with social distancing regulations. In Brussels, Belgium, police used drones fitted with loudspeakers to bark orders to people to “stay at home.” Police drones are being used in Brussels to warn the public that lockdown is in force, and that social distancing regulations must be adhered to.

"Video: Rand Paul Says He’s Getting Daily DEATH THREATS For Questioning Fauci Senator Rand Paul told Sean Hannity Friday that he is receiving death threats almost every day for daring to question the authority of Dr Anthony Fauci, as well as highlighting evidence that the coronavirus could have leaked from a Wuhan lab. “This week, I’ve had five death threats just for being outspoken on it,” Paul said, adding “I don’t know what the world’s coming to, you can’t ask honest, difficult questions that in the end have proved out that Dr. Fauci was not being honest with us.” Paul continued “As a repercussion, my family had white powder sent to our house, and five death threats phoned in.” Watch: Undeterred by the threats, Paul said Friday “There’s been no more prominent scientist in favor of gain-of-function research than Dr. Fauci,” adding “He still hasn’t backed off of that position. He still believes that it’s OK to take animal viruses and make them into super-viruses to infect humans. Even if a pandemic should occur, he says the research is worth it.” “There’s a host of other scientists in this field and they say it’s not worth it at all, that we haven’t learned anything” Paul added. “All we’ve done is put ourselves at risk.” “This is a bad one, this has about one percent mortality, 3.5 million people have died, but they’ve been experimenting with some viruses that have 15 percent mortality. That would be 50 million deaths right now,” The Senator further warned, adding “So this kind of research needs to not be funded by the US taxpayer … It’s very, very dangerous.” As we previously reported, Paul says that he never received any well wishes or sentiments from any Democrats after he was brutally assaulted in 2017, or after receiving the latest death threats, including when white powder was sent to his family home and discovered by his wife Kelley Paul. “Not one of them I don’t think ever said they were sorry for me being assaulted by someone and having six ribs broken and nearly dying and having my lung removed,” Paul said, adding “We have people on the left who think it’s just hilarious.” ——————————————————————————————————————— ALERT!

"Yet Another Scientific Study Concludes COVID Is Likely Lab Engineered Another new scientific study has concluded that it is more likely than not that the COVID pandemic originated with a virus engineered inside a lab. Dr. Stephen Quay and Berkeley physics professor Richard Muller revealed the findings in The Wall Street Journal Sunday, noting that “The most compelling reason to favor the lab leak hypothesis is firmly based in science.” The scientists added that “COVID-19 has a genetic footprint that has never been observed in a natural coronavirus.” The research points to the genome sequencing of the virus ‘CGG-CGG’, which is one of 36 sequencing patterns observed, but does not occur in nature. “The CGG-CGG combination has never been found naturally. That means the common method of viruses picking up new skills, called recombination, cannot operate here,” the scientists assert. “A virus simply cannot pick up a sequence from another virus if that sequence isn’t present in any other virus,” they add, while also noting that the CGG-CGG combination IS commonly used in ‘gain of function’ research, which is known to have been used with coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The scientists urge that those who believe COVID-19 jumped from animals to humans “must explain why it happened to pick its least favorite combination: CGG-CGG.” They further ask for an explanation as to “Why did it replicate the choice the lab’s gain-of-function researchers would have made?” “Yes, it could have happened randomly, through mutations. But do you believe that?” the authors of the study ask, adding “At the minimum, this fact—that the coronavirus, with all its random possibilities, took the rare and unnatural combination used by human researchers—implies that the leading theory for the origin of the coronavirus must be laboratory escape.” This latest study comes on the heels of a revitalised focus on scientific research by Professor Angus Dalgleish of St George’s Hospital, University of London and Norwegian virologist Birger Sorensen which presents compelling evidence suggesting the virus was manufactured in a laboratory. As the scientists noted, they were ostracised and ignored until recently when intelligence findings revealed that workers at the Wuhan lab fell sick with COVID-19 symptoms in November 2019. As the global pandemic unfolded, scores of scientists came forward suggesting the genome sequencing of the virus was unnatural, and should be further investigated. The lab leak theory was effectively shut down, however, when scientists led by Dr Peter Daszak “orchestrated a ‘bullying’ campaign and coerced top scientists into signing off on a letter to The Lancet journal aimed at removing blame for Covid-19 from the Wuhan lab he was funding with US money.” Daszak, who keeps appearing as the lead figure in investigations of the research he funded with US grant money via his own organisation, reportedly used his influence to get The Lancet to publish the letter, which stated that to even suggest the lab leak theory had any credibility was equal to spreading “fear, rumours, and prejudice.” The release of Dr Fauci’s emails has also reconfirmed that Fauci was discussing the lab leak scenario with other scientists, and knew full well that it was a distinct possibility, despite making statements to the contrary in public, before any robust scientific research into the matter had been carried out. Ty & Charlene Bollinger break down the latest in the leaked Fauci e-mails that expose his many lies to the American public. Now former head of the Food and Drug Administration, Scott Gottlieb, has revealed that Fauci briefed world health leaders in the spring of 2020 that the lab leak was a possibility. Appearing on CBS News this past weekend, Gottlieb admitted that Fauci told government health advisors that the virus “looked unusual,” and that scientists he was working with “had suspicions” that it was manipulated. Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb says he was informed by a senior Trump administration official in spring that Dr. Fauci briefed world health leaders in Europe “that this could have been a potential lab leak…so those discussions were going on.” pic.twitter.com/2OlTg8bMof— Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) June 6, 2021 ——————————————————————————————————————— ALERT!

"Twitter bans Naomi Wolf Feminist author and journalist Naomi Wolf has been permanently banned on Twitter for posts about COVID-19, vaccines, and vaccine passports. Some have applauded the ban, while others see it as another example of Big Tech’s suppression of free speech. Wolf is considered one of the most prominent feminists, rising to fame after publishing the book The Beauty Myth. In the past year, however, she has been the subject of criticism as well as support for her strong stance against lockdowns, vaccine passports, and COVID-19 vaccines themselves. Wolf had already been censored by Twitter prior to her ban. At the 2021 Bitcoin conference, Jack Dorsey was confronted by Laura Loomer on his censorship and human rights abuses. Many criticized the ban, describing it as a blow to the freedom of expression and claiming it was the result of pressure from the US government. Twitter said the ban was permanent and would not allow Wolf to appeal it. In a recent congressional hearing, Wolf argued against vaccine passports, saying they would “re-create a situation that is very familiar to me as a student of history. This has been the start of many, many genocides.”",0,0

In 2018, Facebook announced they were going to start censoring “misinformation” that leads to “real-world harm.” “We have identified that there is a type of misinformation that is shared in certain countries that can incite underlying tensions and lead to physical harm offline,” Facebook said. “We have a broader responsibility to not just reduce that type of content but remove it.” They proceeded to go on a mass-censorship spree purging everyone who criticized mass immigration and other social media sites quickly followed suit. Are they going to ban misinformation about non-existent “white privilege” now that it can be plainly seen to be causing real-world harm? Of course not! Just six months ago, Facebook announced they were overhauling their “race-blind” “hate speech” algorithms to explicitly allow more anti-white hatred! This anti-white agenda is being pushed from the top down by the US government working in concert with the richest, most powerful and most privileged companies in the world! Rather than try to ridiculously argue “self-defense,” Amazon driver Itzel Ramirez should argue that she was just doing as she was trained!",0,1
"Joe Biden Neglects D-Day; Tweets About Tulsa Race Massacre President Joe Biden tweeted a video Sunday of his meeting last week with survivors of the Tulsa Race Massacre, but did not mention that June 6 was also the anniversary of D-Day, the U.S-led invasion of Normandy in the Second World War. Biden, who appeared to confuse D-Day with Pearl Harbor Day last year on the campaign trail, tweeted: “I met with survivors of the Tulsa Massacre this week to help fill the silence. Because in silence, wounds deepen. And, as painful as it is, only in remembrance do wounds heal.” He shared a video produced by the White House in which he emphasized the need to tell the truth about America’s past sins: “You can’t pretend it didn’t happen. … It can happen again,” he said.

"Fauci Reportedly Briefed Health Leaders in 2020 of Potential ‘Lab Leak’ of ‘Unusual’ COVID Strain Republican lawmakers have called for Anthony Fauci to be fired for having “blood on his hands”, and demanded that he testify before congressional committees and provide information related to the origins of COVID-19 amid a trove of emails, released by BuzzFeed, dating back to the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. As a flurry of media reports of late have revived speculations regarding the “lab leak” theory, which suggests that COVID-19 was an engineered pathogen, the former head of the Food and Drug Administration, Scott Gottlieb, has claimed that Dr. Anthony Fauci had not entirely dismissed the notion last year. The chief medical adviser to the US president had briefed world leaders in 2020 on the possibility that the novel coronavirus leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China, said Gottlieb, when appearing on CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday. Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb says he was informed by a senior Trump administration official in spring that Dr. Fauci briefed world health leaders in Europe “that this could have been a potential lab leak…so those discussions were going on.” pic.twitter.com/2OlTg8bMof— Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) June 6, 2021 The ex-FDA chief, who served under then-President Donald Trump, had cited a former senior member of the Trump administration as testifying to Fauci’s statements at the time. Gottlieb, added that the same source had recently reconfirmed Fauci’s words dated to 2020. The former FDA commissioner’s book ‘Uncontrolled Spread: Why COVID-19 Crushed US and How We Can Defeat the Next Pandemic’ is set to come out in September. Last spring, when Dr. Fauci had attended a meeting of world health leaders in Europe around the World Health Assembly, he briefed them that the coronavirus outbreak could have been the result of a lab leak, and admitted that the strain looked unusual, Gottlieb revealed. Further on in the conversation on the CBS show, the former FDA chief underscored that when US scientists looked at the strain, they had suspicions. “And it takes time to do that analysis, and that dispelled some of those suspicions,” he added. Gottlieb believed that it was a mistake to look at the virus from only a scientific perspective, adding that it needed to be examined from a national security standpoint. A “scientific mindset looks at the virus and the virus’s behaviour and its sequence and draws a conclusion”, he said, emphasising that a national security assessment “looks at the behaviour of the Chinese government, looks at the behaviour of the lab, looks at other evidence around the lab, including the infections that we now know took place, and that changes the overall assessment”. According to Gottlieb, the “tools of national security weren’t deeply engaged at the outset.” “I think going forward now, looking at these kinds of risks, we need to judge them through the lens of a national security mindset,” he concluded. Former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, in a previous appearance on the same show, slammed China, which he said, was able to provide “exculpatory” evidence proving that COVID did not leak from a lab, but has so far refused to do so. He also cited evidence supposedly in favour of the theory after reports claimed three scientists who worked at the The Wuhan Institute of Virology were hospitalised in November 2019. US media reports suggesting that the employees of the Wuhan Institute fell gravely ill right ahead of the outbreak of COVID-19 have been dismissed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry as “smear campaigns and blame shifting”. Fauci Under Fire Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), is currently under fire over accusations that he was not forthcoming about the idea that COVID-19 might have originated from a lab leak in his discussions within the administration and in the other work he was carrying out. Republican lawmakers have been demanding that Fauci be fired. On Saturday, Republican House Representative Matt Gaetz claimed in an interview that Dr Fauci “has blood on his hands”.Earlier, two top House Republicans said it was “imperative” for Fauci to testify before congressional committees and provide information related to the origins of COVID-19. The barrage of criticism aimed at Fauci has also been fuelled by the recent release by BuzzFeed of 3,200 pages of the chief medical adviser’s emails dating back to the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. In one of the alleged emails, Peter Daszak, head of the EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit organisation with ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, reportedly thanked Fauci for “downplaying the possibility” that COVID-19 had escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Fauci, however, dismissed the recent allegations targeting him and his National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “Are you really saying that we are implicated because we gave a multi-billion dollar institution $120,000 a year for bat surveillance?” he said, according to the Financial Times, in a reference to the grant that, via EcoHealth Alliance, ended up at the lab in China which has been conducting tests on bat coronaviruses for decades. Many who support the “lab leak” theory have been insisting that the mere fact the city that houses the lab became ground zero for the outbreak is too great a coincidence. The idea the COVID-19 virus escaped from a Wuhan lab in China – something that was regarded as somewhat of a “fringe theory” until recently, is now the subject of an official review, after US President Joe Biden ordered the intelligence community to redouble efforts to investigate the origins of the coronavirus and to report their findings to him within 90 days, “including on whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident”. The US President acknowledged that a majority of the intelligence community had “coalesced” around two scenarios, but “do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other”. In March, the World Health Organisation released the full version of its report on the origins of the coronavirus, in which the WHO called a leak of COVID-19 from a laboratory very unlikely, suggesting that the virus was most likely transmitted to humans from bats via another animal.",0,1
"Soaring Used Car Prices May Result In “Shocking” Inflation Report Next Week Used car prices in the US continue to surge due to both the country’s economic recovery and an ongoing supply crunch. There are two components to watch in the core inflation report due next week. First is, and most importantly, are used car prices and second is the rent of shelter. Core inflation in April saw a more significant contribution to used car prices pushing inflation upwards of 2% YoY mainly because prices of used vehicles on the month jumped 21% YoY. For those who haven’t seen what is going on in the used car space, here is a chart of the Mannheim used car index: As the great reset agenda rears it’s ugly head into the public eye, the organization itself is poised to leverage AI to track and target all that stand in their way. “Prices on used vehicles increased by an astonishing 21 % YoY in April (contributing 0.8% to the yearly change in core inflation). According to Manheim Consulting, prices on used cars and trucks are expected to climb further to 50 pct YoY in May or June (3 months lag). If we assume a 50% yearly increase in used cars in May (Manheim may exaggerate the yearly price increase a bit), then core inflation will potentially surpass 4%. Supply chain disruptions, shortage of semiconductors and Covid-19 restrictions have all played a part in disturbing the price action in the car market, but bottlenecks are not always the root cause of inflation – they can also be seen as a symptom,” said Nordea. This means that the May inflation report next week (due June 10) could be an absolute shocker. “We see clear risks of a big positive surprise to the May inflation report as well with core inflation around or just above 4%. The market is still buying the transitory inflation narrative but for how long? Lately, increasing (US) inflation has been the main concern of markets,” Nordea said, adding that, “We are likely in for another inflation shocker in June, but the question is whether the market will explain it away as a transitory effect.” Peering into the real world, Financial Times speaks with people within the industry and in financial markets about what’s fueling used car prices. Carey Cherner, a 36-year-old used car dealer in Maryland, sold a 2001 Ford F-150 pick-up truck with close to 200k miles for $7,500, more than 50% higher than pre-pandemic prices. “There are more people buying cars than there are cars in the market, which makes it go kind of crazy,” Cherner said. Policymakers, such as Federal Reserve members, continue to soothe the market with the word “transitory” almost daily, as a form of a communication tool to admit there are inflationary pressures but avoid market participants from panicking. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, said earlier this week that used car cost pressures “may persist over the summer months, I expect them to fade and likely reverse somewhat in subsequent quarters”. But the problem here is that policymakers have been telling us that these pressures are “transitory” for months and keep pushing out the goalposts of when they want everyone to believe inflation diminishes. Nathan Sheets, the chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income and a former under-secretary at the US Treasury, said there is an “unprecedented level of stimulus plus other forms to support spending” floating around the economy. A combination of helicopter drops by the federal government and supply chain disruptions resulted in the quickest “V-shaped” recovery that ultimately sparked supply constraints, driving up prices. “How sure am I that I am right that inflation is going to dissipate? Probably 80 percent, but that is still a pretty fat tail,” Sheets said. “It’s incredibly tight right now: you have more demand . . . that is supported by fiscal stimulus, so it’s just like a perfect storm. And we see that clearly in prices,” said Laura Rosner, a senior economist at MacroPolicy Perspectives. But Jonathan Smoke of Cox Automotive, a consultancy for automobile dealers, noted that “several leading indicators of what’s happening at our auctions” suggest “the price appreciation streak is likely going to end.” However, in Maryland, Cherner doesn’t believe there will be a “steep drop-off [in prices] until there’s way more supply than there is demand. They [automakers] still have to build the new cars and get the chips in them and get them out. I just think it’s going to last.” So the main driver in next week’s inflation report will most likely be surging used car prices, and the red hot numbers may cause the Fed to start tapering or at least continue to communicate a future wind-down of its emergency pandemic policies this summer.",0,0

The emails written in the early months of the outbreak reveal that Fauci took an active interest in gain-of-function research, which involves lab experiments on pathogens to make them more deadly or contagious, while publicly rushing to downplay speculation that the virus might have originated from a lab. Commentators have also taken issue with a WHO official with ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology praising Fauci for dismissing the theory that the virus was man-made. While the GOP called for Fauci to either step down or be fired for his flip-flopping on a number of issues, such as the mask mandate, as well as the alleged government funding of gain-of-function research, the White House has stood firmly behind him. On Friday, President Joe Biden said that he was “very confident” in Fauci, while White House press secretary Jen Psaki later appeared to rule out the idea of Biden firing Fauci, saying she “can’t imagine such a scenario.”",0,1

"Watch: Vaccinated People SHOCKED When Magnet Sticks to Injection Site Remarkable footage uploaded to Banned.video proves a bizarre magnetic side effect is happening to some people who receive the Covid-19 vaccine. In a video report by The Liberty Broadcast, the crew tests whether a refrigerator magnet will stick to Covid-19 vaccine injection sites, as demonstrated in countless viral videos on social media. The theory had reportedly been debunked according to Newsweek and other mainstream outlets; however, when tested on vaccinated bar goers visiting Austin’s famous Sixth Street, the magnet sticks to them. “The magnets appear to stick to the arm on the site where the COVID-19 vaccine shot was allegedly administered (apparently proving the microchip conspiracy theory). But experts told Newsweek that a magnet will not stick to someone’s arm because of the injection,” Newsweek wrote last month. Meanwhile, the exact same phenomenon is being witnessed and documented across the globe. As the side effect continues to be proven real, it begs the question: why is the establishment trying to hide it? One reason could be that news of a magnetized vaccine injection site would likely alarm people and discourage them from seeking the vaccine. A more sinister motive, however, could be that the medical establishment is trying to keep the public in the dark that the vaccines contain magnetized proteins synthesized for mass mind control. Whatever the reason, the random street experiment above proves the phenomenon is definitely happening to certain vaccinated members of the population.

"Cricketing Authorities Considering Exposing Another Player For Tweets He Posted When He Was 15 Following the international suspension of cricketer Ollie Robinson for tweets he posted when he was 18, the ECB is now considering whether to expose the identity of another player for posting “offensive” tweets when he was 15. Yes, really. As we previously highlighted, Robinson was “made an example of” by cricketing authorities after his teenage tweets, which largely consisted of a few “racist” words and some lads’ banter, were uncovered by offense archeologists. Now another cricketer could be about to face cancellation “Wisden.com chose to obscure the identity of the player, who was 15 at the of the tweet, but did include details of the post, including ‘your going out with a asian’ and three hashtags: ‘Asianthroughandthrough’, ‘hweolloo’ and ‘c****y’,” reports the Daily Mail. Wow. Big deal. According to the Mail, the ECB is “considering” whether to publicly name the individual, opening him up to be targeted by witch hunt mobs and forced into a groveling apology, which as it proved for Robinson, will achieve absolutely nothing. So according to the left, “cancel culture doesn’t exist,” and yet another sports star may be about to say goodbye to his whole career for tweets he posted when he was literally a child.

"Watch: Brian Williams & Lincoln Project Compare Antifa Terrorists To D-Day Heroes In Delusional Video A new Lincoln Project video promoted by MSNBC’s Brian Williams likens the far-left terrorist group Antifa to America’s military veterans who fought in WWII. The work of fighting fascism has always been our nation’s greatest project — in 1944 and today.Thanks to Brian Williams for marking #DDay on @11thHour with our new ad 👇 pic.twitter.com/S5i9ySQtqZ— The Lincoln Project (@ProjectLincoln) June 5, 2021 The propaganda piece was aired in commemoration of the 77th anniversary of the June 1944 Allied invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during World War II, also known as D-Day. Williams started the segment by describing D-Day, saying, “Over 150,000 men invading the French coastline under withering German fire to begin their march across Europe where they would go on to win WWII 336 days later.” Williams then pitched to the Lincoln Project video, which began, “Who is Antifa? They stormed the beaches of Normandy, parachuted into the French countryside and gave their lives to face down and fight back against fascism.” “They took down Nazi machine gun nests, tore apart the Third Reich’s strongholds, liberated concentration camps, liberated France, Italy, Belgium, Holland,” the montage continued. “Anywhere Antifa saw fascism, they fearlessly and relentlessly annihilated it. Fascism was defeated because of patriots like these, proud Americans who knew that the fight against fascists was not simply a battle between opposing nations, it was a war against inhumanity, a war that isn’t nice but cannot be lost, a war we still fight today.” Without a hint of irony, the video being aired on MSNBC ended by stating, “Antifascism, it’s not a cable news talking point, it’s an American ideal that should be memorialized because it was paid for in blood.” Equating a domestic terror group with some of the country’s most highly regarded veterans is a new low, even for MSNBC.

"NASA’s Juno to Get a Close Look at Jupiter’s Moon Ganymede The first of the gas-giant orbiter’s back-to-back flybys will provide a close encounter with the massive moon after over 20 years. On Monday, June 7, at 1:35 p.m. EDT (10:35 a.m. PDT), NASA’s Juno spacecraft will come within 645 miles (1,038 kilometers) of the surface of Jupiter’s largest moon, Ganymede. The flyby will be the closest a spacecraft has come to the solar system’s largest natural satellite since NASA’s Galileo spacecraft made its penultimate close approach back on May 20, 2000. Along with striking imagery, the solar-powered spacecraft’s flyby will yield insights into the moon’s composition, ionosphere, magnetosphere, and ice shell. Juno’s measurements of the radiation environment near the moon will also benefit future missions to the Jovian system. Ganymede is bigger than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the solar system with its own magnetosphere – a bubble-shaped region of charged particles surrounding the celestial body. “Juno carries a suite of sensitive instruments capable of seeing Ganymede in ways never before possible,” said Juno Principal Investigator Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. “By flying so close, we will bring the exploration of Ganymede into the 21st century, both complementing future missions with our unique sensors and helping prepare for the next generation of missions to the Jovian system – NASA’s Europa Clipper and ESA’s [European Space Agency’s] JUpiter ICy moons Explorer [JUICE] mission.” Juno’s science instruments will begin collecting data about three hours before the spacecraft’s closest approach. Along with the Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) and Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) instruments, Juno’s Microwave Radiometer’s (MWR) will peer into Ganymede’s water-ice crust, obtaining data on its composition and temperature. “Ganymede’s ice shell has some light and dark regions, suggesting that some areas may be pure ice while other areas contain dirty ice,” said Bolton. “MWR will provide the first in-depth investigation of how the composition and structure of the ice varies with depth, leading to a better understanding of how the ice shell forms and the ongoing processes that resurface the ice over time.” The results will complement those from ESA’s forthcoming JUICE mission, which will look at the ice using radar at different wavelengths when it becomes the first spacecraft to orbit a moon other than Earth’s Moon in 2032. Signals from Juno’s X-band and Ka-band radio wavelengths will be used to perform a radio occultation experiment to probe the moon’s tenuous ionosphere (the outer layer of an atmosphere where gases are excited by solar radiation to form ions, which have an electrical charge). “As Juno passes behind Ganymede, radio signals will pass through Ganymede’s ionosphere, causing small changes in the frequency that should be picked up by two antennas at the Deep Space Network’s Canberra complex in Australia,” said Dustin Buccino, a signal analysis engineer for the Juno mission at JPL. “If we can measure this change, we might be able to understand the connection between Ganymede’s ionosphere, its intrinsic magnetic field, and Jupiter’s magnetosphere.” Three Cameras, Two Jobs Normally, Juno’s Stellar Reference Unit (SRU) navigation camera is tasked with helping keep the Jupiter orbiter on course, but during the flyby it will do double duty. Along with its navigation duties, the camera – which is well shielded against radiation that could otherwise adversely affect it – will gather information on the high-energy radiation environment in the region near Ganymede by collecting a special set of images. “The signatures from penetrating high-energy particles in Jupiter’s extreme radiation environment appear as dots, squiggles, and streaks in the images – like static on a television screen. We extract these radiation-induced noise signatures from SRU images to obtain diagnostic snapshots of the radiation levels encountered by Juno,” said Heidi Becker, Juno’s radiation monitoring lead at JPL. Meanwhile, the Advanced Stellar Compass camera, built at the Technical University of Denmark, will count very energetic electrons that penetrate its shielding with a measurement every quarter of a second. Also being enlisted is the JunoCam imager. Conceived to bring the excitement and beauty of Jupiter exploration to the public, the camera has provided an abundance of useful science as well during the mission’s almost five-year tenure at Jupiter. For the Ganymede flyby, JunoCam will collect images at a resolution equivalent to the best from Voyager and Galileo. The Juno science team will scour the images, comparing them to those from previous missions, looking for changes in surface features that might have occurred over four-plus decades. Any changes to crater distribution on the surface could help astronomers better understand the current population of objects that impact moons in the outer solar system. Due to the speed of the flyby, the icy moon will – from JunoCam’s viewpoint – go from being a point of light to a viewable disk then back to a point of light in about 25 minutes. So that’s just enough time for five images. “Things usually happen pretty quick in the world of flybys, and we have two back-to-back next week. So literally every second counts,” said Juno Mission Manager Matt Johnson of JPL. “On Monday, we are going to race past Ganymede at almost 12 miles per second (19 kilometers per second). Less than 24 hours later we’re performing our 33rd science pass of Jupiter – screaming low over the cloud tops, at about 36 miles per second (58 kilometers per second). It is going to be a wild ride.” More About the Mission JPL, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, California, manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Scott J. Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio.

"The Origins of Keynesian Economics: How Did It Get So Popular? The British Austrian economist W.H. Hutt was a great critic of Keynes’s economic theories. However, his speculations on why the New Economics revolution happened are even more fascinating. Hutt shows it to be a fundamentally dishonest undertaking. Keynes held a long-standing belief in inflation and public spending. His General Theory was the culmination of his search for an intellectual foundation on which to support his belief. Yet it was an unstable foundation. Had he stated his thesis in clear terms, it would have been seen as noncontroversial in some parts and in the rest untrue. The staggering complexity, deliberate obscurantism and “dialectical tricks” of The General Theory were part of a necessary stratagem of disguise.1 At the time of publication of Keynes’s General Theory, the economy of the United Kingdom was in deep stagnation. Britain had been suffering from chronic levels of mass unemployment. Hutt diagnosed the situation as a pricing problem. Many wages were fixed above market-clearing levels. This came about because a deliberate monetary deflation had been instituted to compensate for the wartime inflation. This was done in order to maintain gold convertibility of the British pound at the prewar gold backing. However, some segments of the labor market had fixed wages at higher nominal levels which perhaps were above market clearance before and were surely much more so after the rollback. Wage rigidity was primarily the doing of labor unions through strike threats and organized coercion. Generous welfare incentive payments, which encouraged the idle to remain unemployed, were a contributing factor. Depressed conditions made labor less valuable to business firms. Unemployed workers could have worked at some wage. A fair-value offer would be lower in bad times than in good times, but productive labor always has some value to the employer. Yet the price rigidities and disincentives made idleness (perhaps supplemented by off-the-books side hustles) more attractive than regular employment. Reading between the lines, contemporary British economists were aware that there was no fundamental reason that a free market in labor could not put people back to work. Prices above market clearance result in a surplus. Profit motivation by business firms, and competition in labor markets among workers would push wages down until the labor surplus was no more. Markets can and will clear—at higher quantities and lower prices. Understanding this point did not require an entirely new theory of economics. British economists were also aware that the main barriers to wages that would clear labor markets were political. The unions were a formidable foe. Hutt described “the belief of some economists that any policy which aims at the removal of man-made barriers … to the pricing of outputs at market-clearing levels, is politically impossible.”2 F.A. Hayek on the same issue wrote that Keynes assumed that “a direct lowering of money wages could be brought about only by a struggle so painful and prolonged that it could not be contemplated.” The cure for the British disease was, then, a political one. Had economists and politicians attempted to marshal public opinion in favor of full-on confrontation against the institutional barriers preventing the price system from working, then the economy could have recovered. The inflexible wages preventing the full participation of labor in productive activity would have flexed. Hutt hoped for the emergence of “a really great statesman, with wise and courageous advisers” who would tell the public the truth: that stagnation was caused by the monopolistic behavior of labor unions; that unemployment benefits discouraged production; and that market pricing—even if some prices were lower—would bring better days ahead for all.3 If influencers had told the hard truth, then public opinion might have responded. Yet it was not so. Those in position to speak out were unwilling to do so, for fear of losing votes and ending careers. And due to a British common law tradition of respect for labor unions, such criticism would not have gone down well. The loss of dole would be equally unwelcome. The cancel culture of the day had its way. Hutt laid the blame equally on the economics profession for knowing—but not telling—the truth.4 Hutt gives the example of Pigou, whose published work demonstrated that he understood the issue. However, “he still conspicuously refrained from recommending the only remaining non-inflationary solution, that of pricing labour’s inputs lower so that they would be within reach of final consumers’ pockets.”5 Political and economic elites began to look for an easier way out. Having ruled out the truth, “they groped for other diagnoses.”6 The problem was how to avoid the pain of confronting the real issue. The solution was inflation. In proper doses, and if precisely targeted, it was thought, inflation could break the logjam. If consumer goods prices rose against rigid nominal wages, real wages would fall until they reached labor’s marginal product. Businesses could then hire. And labor could hold its head high, and proudly pretend that it had not taken a pay cut. All gain, no pain. Thus began a subtle shift in elite opinion, which had up to that time considered inflation a shameful thing. While openly advocating monetary debasement was not (quite) yet respectable in British policy circles, “the notion that ‘cheap money’ could bring prosperity and mitigate unemployment without serious contra-effects was growing in industrial and business circles in both continents,” wrote Hutt.7 The notion began to catch on that, if aggregate purchasing power was deficient because aggregate supply was deficient (owing to input prices and output prices having been forced—by trade union or other monopolistic pressures—above full employment levels) this deficiency might be remedied in some manner by the stimulation of aggregate demand.8 The obstacle to this path was Say’s law. This is the name we now give to a truth articulated by Ricardo, Mill, and Say during the general glut debate. This was an eighteenth-century controversy between Malthus and the three classical economists on the proposition that depressions were caused by an oversupply of goods in general. Looked at differently this could be described as a deficiency of demand in general. Ricardo, Mill, and Say observed that the supply of one good constitutes a demand for some other good, supplied by another producer. If every demand constitutes a supply and vice versa, then demand in general and supply in general are identical. They are only different aspects of the same phenomenon. While there can be a glut of a particular good, demand in general can never be excess or deficient relative to supply. Say’s law and price flexibility formed Hutt’s two-pronged critique of the policy of inflation. Hutt argued that demand in Britain was indeed deficient, but only because supply was deficient. And supply was deficient, because the services of some workers’ labor were not priced for market clearance. Those workers were idle, because employers were not willing or able to raise their bids. Hutt writes that Keynesianism before Keynes (stimulation of demand through inflation) was “widespread” in Britain and the US. Keynes was known to have drawn inspiration from the monetary cranks—a term applied to a collection of historical thinkers who have advanced schemes for printing the way to prosperity.9 Hayek’s article on Foster and Catchings deals with an American version of Keynes’s paradox of thrift ten years before. Hutt (citing Keynes’s biographer, Roy Harrod) states that Keynes had spent at least a dozen years prior to the publication of his General Theory fixated on his lifetime goal. He badly wanted to be the advocate of inflation and public spending. He intuitively felt that this was what the country needed. Finding defensible economic reasoning was another thing. A century of sound economic theory stood in his way. And there was that pesky Say’s law. Inflation was still disreputable, even “suicidal.”10 He could not see a clear path forward. Keynes spent the 1920s and ’30s “searching for arguments to support a conviction.”11 Hutt explains, His “hunch” throughout was that control of expenditure through monetary and fiscal policy could solve the problems of maladjustment expressed in unemployment. And he seems originally to have believed that this could be done without the disastrous sociological consequences of [inflation]. His intellectual speculations consisted, I think, of a groping around—with great ingenuity—for ways of thinking which appeared to support his “hunch,” selecting and eagerly clutching those which appeared to do so, and inhibiting those which did not. The process was unconscious.12 Because the conclusion was fixed, only the means of reaching it needed to change: Supremely confident, conscious of his reputation and rhetorical skill, he appears to have been self-critical only when his previous speculations had tended to lead him away from instead of toward conclusions to which he was intuitively attached. When he discarded concepts and apparatus which he had earlier introduced, it was because he had found more convincing ways, although sometimes quite different and inconsistent ways, of stating a case which, in its essence, he had not modified…. while his convictions about policy seem indeed to have been unshakable, he constantly changed the arguments, assumptions, terminology, and formulas which could be used to justify those convictions. In other words, his fundamental ideas were subject to change only in respect of the particular concepts, formulas, or jargon in which he dressed them.13 Proving that markets don’t clear without violating the laws of economics was roughly as difficult as proving 1+1 =3. This task required an extraordinary degree of rhetoric to paper over the flagrant violations of logic. An initial attempt in 1930, Keynes’s A Treatise on Money, failed when Hayek tore it to shreds in a devastating review.14 The goal remained, but a different route was needed. Where he had failed once, Keynes succeeded with The General Theory. Perhaps the most obscurantist work in the history of economic thought, the book was lipstick on the inflationary pig. Through a rehabilitation of the discarded monetary cranks, a fallacious attempt to refute Say’s law, a policy of spending and inflation, was derived. It was necessary to dress up the conclusion in a model of staggering complexity so as to have plausible deniability that it was, in reality, so simple a thing. Even Keynes supporters acknowledge that the book is poorly written and impenetrable. The impenetrable nature of the writing was a feature, not a bug. Hutt explained, “an inspired insight enabled the Keynesians to perceive that, if inflation were called by another name, ‘the maintenance of effective demand’ for instance, [it could] become respectable and even respected”15 Hutt’s commentary continues: But Keynes, perceiving that it would be politically suicidal to mention the unmentionable, saw a way out through the most successful conjuring trick in history which, deceiving an audience that wished to be deceived, led to its being hailed as a great discovery, as revolutionary and important as Einstein’s theory of relativity. I am not accusing Keynes of intellectual dishonesty. He deceived himself with his “conjuring trick.”16 The success of The General Theory came, in Hutt’s view, from three factors. First, it gave academic legitimacy to inflationism, which governments wanted to do anyway. They had only been prevented because it was widely considered to be an unsound policy. Second, it provided an escape hatch from what Hutt described as “the ‘political impossibility’ of persuading any government to protect or facilitate [market pricing of labor].17 The third and final component was as a theoretical bridge to the policies that Keynes had always wanted. Hutt explained Keynes’s joy over the success of The General Theory this way: “That Keynes was exhilarated is understandable. He had found arguments to support policies which he knew were bound to be extraordinarily popular and influential” and “[t]he thesis that underconsumption is the origin of recession is, of course, tailor-made for political acceptability. It meant an enormous advantage for the popularity of ‘the new economics’ against the old.”18 Hayek famously decided not to write a critique of The General Theory. Had he done so, would the revolution have been stopped? Many since have said so, but perhaps not. In his magisterial The Keynesian Episode: A Reassessment, Hutt says that the success was largely a factor of Keynes’s personality, charisma, and immense influence within the academy and in the political sphere. So great was his reach that his opposition could be fatal to a career in public life. It was almost as if Keynes had something akin to Jedi mind tricks. Hutt was befuddled that eminent economists—men who had demonstrated a sound grasp of the discipline—would inexplicably become brain dead in Keynes’s presence. He could win any argument in person, but when forced to defend his points in writing—giving opponents time to penetrate what Murray N. Rothbard called “a vast network of fallacy”—not so much.19 Hutt documents a “retreat” by Keynes, and by his followers after he left the scene. The major original thesis of the work, unemployment equilibrium, was quickly seen to be a fallacy. From there the major propositions of his work fell one by one, either to friendly fire as his followers tactically retreated, or through hostile attack. Yet The General Theory created an enduring structure that remains in place with no foundations. Hutt, in 1974, wrote: Paradoxically [these economists] still seem to leave the impression that, after all, Say’s law does not work—at least not in the manner in which the old general equilibrium analysis suggested that it did; and they suggest that in some way the world must feel grateful to Keynes, not so much for his contributions to economic method as for the beneficial policy consequences of his General Theory up to some unspecified turning-point some years ago.20 Like a tailored suit, the revolution was custom fit to the policy of inflation and debt. It succeeded due to its failures. On reading the book, Hutt though it would “have a quite unparalleled influence by reason of what [he] judged to be its demerits as a contribution to thought.”21 He described the revolution as “a maze [that] gradually led the majority of economists … [in] which many are still lost.”22 Keynes developed the theory to support his lifelong goal, only to see politicians and central bankers use his revolution to support their goals. The financial media and Fed economists seek to promote consumption, Congress is addicted to “stimulus,” and Fed economists believe that by printing money they are supporting production. Hutt’s speculations go a long way toward answering the question of how we got here. Say’s law is often stated as “Supply creates its own demand.” The Keynesian revolution demonstrates the inverse in the realm of intellectual production: demand for economic fallacies creating its own supply.",0,0

"Why Corporate Lobbyists and Special Interest Groups Won’t Go Away Throughout much of human history, a political ruler was often considered to be only as good as his ability to distribute gifts, booty, and other material rewards to his most valuable and loyal servants. In the “barbarian” days of northern Europe, military men expected their kings to lead them to booty, and to distribute gifts to the best fighters after the battle was won. In later ages, the more powerful kings could dole out titles of nobility, lands to faithful servants, and bureaucratic offices with hefty salaries to trusted advisors. In exchange for all this largesse, subjects could offer their personal loyalty, but they could also offer military services, special know-how, and help in drumming up additional support for the crown. Those kings who could distribute the most gifts could often expect the most loyalty and assistance from others. After all, here was a king who could make you rich. Offering “help” to the rich and powerful has often come with many potential benefits. Few go to kings anymore for gifts of swords and gold. But the game has not fundamentally changed. In the modern world, the kings have largely been replaced by faceless bureaucratic regimes composed of countless agencies, commissions, panels, committees, and executive officers. Regime executives can still dole out jobs to loyalists and favored interest groups. Policymakers can rewrite laws and regulations to favor those who can offer the regime something in return. For ordinary people, who don’t get many favors from the regime, there is a big downside in this game. The riches go to the politically powerful, and not to those who work the hardest or are the most productive. Wealth is continually redistributed through a process of state coercion rather than through the voluntary market process. As a result, wealth flows into industries and firms on the basis of how much they’re valued by policymakers. Politicians know this is a problem, so they try to play both sides. We hear from politicians every election cycle about getting “big money” out of politics. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders both made this notion central to their presidential campaigns. But what can really be done about it? People like Sanders, not surprisingly, think the answer is in more government regulation. In practice, however, the solution lies only in reducing the power and wealth of the regime. Why We Have Pressure Groups and Lobbyists Nowadays, in order to secure wealth and favors from the regime, pressure groups hire lobbyists and public relations consultants. Powerful corporations go to the regime seeking tax breaks, subsidies, and anticompetitive regulations. Today we call this “rent seeking” (from an old definition of the word “rent” once favored by economists). These rent-seeking firms want access to the treasure trove of wealth hoarded by the regime. And why shouldn’t these corporate interests and pressure groups seek favors? In the United States, the federal government in 2020 controlled a budget of more than 6 trillion dollars. Moreover, the same government also has control over countless regulations and statutes that can make or break one’s business or household budget. It’s easy to figure out where to go if one’s looking to protect or enhance one’s livelihood. Indeed, rent seeking by pressure groups and corporations is the natural outcome in any polity where the regime controls immense amounts of wealth. Reducing the Size and Power of the State The answer to all of this is simple—although certainly not easy to accomplish. First, if we want less rent seeking, we must reduce the benefits of rent seeking in the first place. This means stripping the state of much of its ability to dole out rewards to those seeking special favors. It means reducing the size of the state and its coffers overall. It means stripping federal policymakers of their power to regulate the economy for the benefit of some at the expense of others. Without these powers and funds, the federal government suddenly becomes a much less fruitful target for lobbying, bribes, and other means of obtaining special favors. There are, of course, many obstacles to reductions in a regime’s size and scope in terms of the wealth it controls. Political scientists have demonstrated this for years with theories like the so-called iron triangle, which shows how interest groups, legislators, and bureaucrats work together to increase or safeguard the regime’s control over resources. Just as the kings of old increased their own power and influence by controlling the flow of resources to their subjects, today’s policymakers also know they can increase or preserve their power by being able to control who gets what, when, and how. Decentralization as a Means of Reducing Rent Seeking A second strategy for reducing the power of interest groups and corporate cronyism lies in decentralizing the power of regimes. As noted by Murray Rothbard in his history of economic thought, one of history’s most notable surges in rent-seeking behavior began with the rise of absolutism in Europe. As European regimes centralized political power, they also created a system of “state building, state privilege, and what might be called ‘state monopoly capitalism.’” This was also characterized by a system of “heavy royal expenditure, of high taxes, of … inflation and deficit finance.” In other words, it was an era in which the rapidly centralizing regimes seized unprecedented amounts of control over national economies and doled out privileges accordingly. Moreover, as suggested by Baysinger, Ekelund, and Tollison suggest in their essay “Mercantilism as a Rent-Seeking Society,” as regimes become more powerful, it makes more sense to devote more resources to rent-seeking. As regimes centralize, “the relative costs of negotiating favored treatment with a state in which authority [is] vested in a central figure” fall.1 If, on the other hand, regimes are decentralized, this raises the cost of rent seeking and make outcomes more difficult to predict. In other words, rent seeking declines when “the costs of negotiating and enforcing exclusive rights [are] relatively higher.”2 We can see how this has played out in the United States. Prior to the New Deal, most government spending in America was done at the local level. The federal regulatory state was weak. This meant that if one was seeking government favors, there was no easy single target from which immense rewards could be reaped. Large corporations and pressure groups could lobby for benefits state by state and city by city. But that’s expensive and time consuming. Certainly, many smaller organizations sought favors from state-level legislatures and bureaucrats. But the fractured political system limited the ease and extent to which single interest groups could obtain sizable government benefits. And decentralization certainly made it harder to gain national prominence and influence. That all changed with the New Deal and throughout the second half of the twentieth century as the federal government began to outspend the state governments and since immense new powers were now held by a well-funded and powerful federal government. It is no coincidence that nine of the twenty wealthiest counties in America are suburbs of Washington, DC. The symbiotic relationship between pressure groups and the regime is very rewarding. Today, the political system really is in many ways what H.L. Mencken suggested when he described elections as a sort of “advance auction of stolen goods.” The only answer lies in reducing the number of stolen goods available, or at least making it more costly to get them.",0,0
"AMC stock soars over 20% as Reddit-fueled rally extends to another week Speculative trading activity in AMC Entertainment, the meme stock that has become popular with small investors recently, has pushed the shares of the struggling movie theater chain to double-digit growth. Shares of AMC surged 23% to nearly $57 on Monday, following an 80% rally in the previous week. AMC has gained more than 120% since the beginning of the month, after a wild growth of 160% in May, pushing its 2021 rally to over 2,600%. Last week, the trading frenzy sent AMC stock to an intraday record of $72.62. A speculative buying mania swept Wall Street in January due to a wave of stay-at-home traders who used social media, in this case Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, to coordinate massive short squeezes. As a result, meme stocks like GameStop, a struggling brick-and-mortar video game retailer, and American basic cable television channel AMC catapulted. On Monday, other meme stocks also gained momentum. Bed Bath & Beyond soared 7%, BlackBerry surged over 8%, while GameStop advanced nearly 6%. “It is extremely tempting to short these stocks, but unless you have huge liquid resources, please try to resist the temptation because these prices can go to unimaginable highs before they settle down to a reasonable valuation, and you may have to cover on the high point,” Interactive Brokers chairman Thomas Peterffy told CNBC. “On the long term, stocks always approach their fundamental values, which in this case is much, much lower,” he added. Taking advantage of the rally, AMC sold 20 million shares last week, raising $800 million for the struggling company. CEO Adam Aron said he plans to sell up to 25 million more shares.",0,0
"China’s vast foreign reserves grow to $3.22 TRILLION Chinese gold and foreign currency reserves, the world’s largest, rose more than expected last month, according to official data published on Monday. The nation’s foreign exchange reserves increased by $23.62 billion to $3.22 trillion in May against $3.208 trillion seen in a Reuters poll of analysts and $3.198 trillion recorded in April. The growth is partially attributed to the weakened US dollar. The Chinese national currency, the yuan, rose 1.6% against the greenback in May, while the dollar dropped 1.6% during last month versus a basket of other major currencies. China’s gold holdings stood at 62.64 million fine troy ounces at the end of May, unchanged from the previous month. The value of the gold reserves surged to $119.02 billion at the end of May from $110.73 billion in late April. The world’s largest forex reserves continued to rise as China has been gradually recovering from the pandemic-related crisis. Last month, the country’s imports grew at their fastest pace in 10 years, fueled by surging demand for raw materials. However, export growth slowed more than expected, weighed by disruptions caused by Covid-19 cases at the country’s major southern ports.",0,0
