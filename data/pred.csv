"Top Japanese virologist warns of risks of Tokyo Games during pandemic-paper A top Japanese virologist and government adviser has said there was a risk of spreading COVID-19 infections during the Tokyo Olympics, the Times of London reported on Tuesday, the latest high-profile warning about the global sporting showpiece.Tohoku University professor Hitoshi Oshitani was an architect of Japan's ""Three Cs” approach to the pandemic, which advises avoiding closed spaces, crowds and close contact situations.“The government and the organising committee, including the IOC (International Olympic Committee), keep saying they’re holding a safe Olympics. But everybody knows there is a risk. It’s 100 per cent impossible to have an Olympics with zero risk...of the spread of infection in Japan and also in other countries after the Olympics,"" the Times quoted Oshitani as telling the newspaper.""There are a number of countries that do not have many cases, and a number that don’t have any variants. We should not make the Olympics (an occasion) to spread the virus to these countries,"" he added, noting most countries lack vaccines.Already postponed from last year because of the pandemic, a scaled-down version of the Games with no foreign spectators is set to start on July 23 despite public fears the event could spread the coronavirus and drain medical resources.However, a former Olympian turned public health expert said she believed the Games can be pulled off with an acceptable level of risk.""There will be cases, but having one case or a couple of cases doesn't mean that it was a failure,"" Tara Kirk Sell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Reuters on Tuesday.PRAYING FOR PANDEMIC RELIEFPlaybooks from event organisers detailing testing regimes and movement restrictions for athletes and other visitors ""outline a good strategy"" for minimising contagion, Sell added.Media arriving from abroad to cover the Games will be closely monitored to ensure they don't leave pre-registered areas such as hotels and sports venues, Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto said. She also said Japan's Olympics-related staff were expected to start getting vaccinated in mid-June.  read more ""... we are still in a very difficult situation, but we have seen a gradual decrease of infections in Tokyo, and I am praying that the pandemic is brought under control as swiftly as possible,"" Hashimoto said at the start of a Tokyo 2020 board meeting.Japan has been spared the explosive outbreaks seen elsewhere but has recorded over 760,000 cases and more than 13,600 deaths. Tokyo and other regions are under a state of emergency as the nation battles a fourth wave which is straining hospitals.The government's top medical adviser, Shigeru Omi, said last week medical experts planned a statement on the Games by June 20, when the state of emergency is set to be lifted.A labour union in the northern island of Hokkaido, where the Olympic marathon will be held, petitioned its governor on Monday calling for the Games to be cancelled, media said.Japanese Olympic Committee board member Kaori Yamaguchi, a judo bronze medallist at the 1988 Games, said on Friday Japan  had been ""cornered"" into pressing ahead with the Games.  read more Japan's public remains divided about holding the Games, although opposition appears to be easing somewhat. A poll by broadcaster TBS this week showed 55% wanted the Games either postponed or cancelled - down 10 points from last month.Sell, a silver medallist swimmer at the 2004 Games in Athens, said accelerating vaccinations and ebbing case numbers in Japan are positive signs the Olympics can go on, but noted the risks involved in any type of international travel.""These Games are very much a symbol of the whole world emerging from this terrible, global pandemic,"" she said.“If we wanted to be as safe as possible, we’d never leave our house.”(This story corrects spelling of scientist’s name in second paragraph)Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Muslim Neighborhoods in British Towns are ‘No-Go Areas’ for White People, New Book Claims An academic who studied Muslim integration in Britain has revealed in a new book that women and children in some communities are subjected to Taliban-like rules, and non-Muslims face threats of violence. Ed Husain, professor at the Walsh School of Foreign Service in Georgetown University, visited mosques across Britain, speaking to businesses owners, imams and locals about life in predominantly Muslim neighbourhoods. He used his on-the-ground research to write a book, ‘Among The Mosques: A Journey Across Muslim Britain’, which is set for release next week. The Muslim author grew up in a Bangladeshi family in London and was radicalised in his youth before renouncing extremism. According to the professor, integration issues in the UK continue to persist. One man in Blackburn told Husain that “Asian” teengers repeatedly “jumped” his 12-year-old son simply for “being white.” Another local told the author that certain parts of the town had become “no-go areas.” Blackburn has the largest Muslim population in the UK outside of London, and is a major hub for ultra-orthodox Islamic sects. Husain also learned that one school in the town had barred girls from participating in swimming lessons, saying that it was inappropriate for them to be seen in bathing costumes. While visiting a bookstore in Blackburn, the author stumbled across several volumes advocating strict restrictions and dress codes for women, as well as copies of a book which argued that it is sinful to enjoy dancing and listening to music. The town also reportedly has restaurants that provide gender separation for their clientele. While visiting Bradford, Husain was amazed by how few white residents there were, and was reportedly told by a taxi driver that they had “gone with the wind.” He noted that mosques were on nearly every corner and that even private homes served as places of worship and religious schools. The professor also learned that some Muslim parents in the area had prohibited their children from going to drawing and dance lessons. An imam in the city confided that there was “widespread abuse of disabled children in the Muslim community,” and that parents were pocketing social welfare money while neglecting their children. In Didsbury, the author came across a sign for a local ‘Sharia Department’, which deals with marital issues and other disputes through the lens of Islamic law. He reported similar interactions and situations in places like Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. One woman told him that some Muslim communities in the UK had become a “different universe” from the rest of the country. Like other European countries, the UK has struggled with integrating immigrants from Muslim-majority nations, sparking concern about radicalisation. At the same time, reports suggest that there is a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment in the country. During Husain’s trip to Bradford, a local predicted that anti-Muslim sentiment could lead to “an apartheid city” within 30 years and give rise to Nazi-like political parties that would persecute immigrants.",0,0

"Resigned to a nuclear deal revival, Gulf engages with foe Iran Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, resigned to the revival of a nuclear pact with Iran they always opposed, are engaging with Tehran to contain tensions while lobbying for future talks to take their security concerns into account.World powers have been negotiating in Vienna with Iran and the United States to revive the 2015 deal, under which Tehran agreed to curbs on its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions.The new U.S. administration of President Joe Biden wants to restore the deal, which Washington abandoned under his predecessor, Donald Trump. But Washington's Gulf allies have always said the deal was inadequate because it ignored other issues, such as Iran's missile exports and support for regional proxy fighters.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made clear on Monday that Washington's priority was to get the deal ""back in the box"" and then use it as a platform to address other questions.But with Saudi Arabia embroiled in a costly war in Yemen and facing repeated missile and drone attacks on its oil infrastructure which it blames on Iran and its allies, the Gulf States say the wider issues must not be set aside.""The Gulf countries have said 'fine the U.S. can go back to (the nuclear deal), this is their decision we cannot change it, but...we need everybody to take into account regional security concerns',"" Gulf Research Center's Abdulaziz Sager, who has been active in past unofficial Saudi-Iran dialogue, said this week.Gulf officials worry that they lack the same clout with the Biden administration that they had under Trump. They lobbied to join the Vienna talks, but were rebuffed. Rather than wait for the outcome in Vienna, Riyadh accepted Iraqi overtures in April to host talks between Saudi and Iranian officials, two sources familiar with the matter said.""WE NEED TO LIVE WITH THEM""As the foes suss each other out, Riyadh has said it wants to see “verifiable deeds”. Iran holds a number of cards, not least its support for the Houthi movement in Yemen, which the Saudis have failed to defeat after six years of war that exhausted Washington's patience.""Yemen is a cheap course for Iran and a very expensive one for Saudi Arabia. This gives Iran a strong bargaining position,"" Sager said.The UAE, for its part, has already been in regular contact with Iran trying to de-escalate, notably since tankers were attacked off its coast in 2019, a third regional source said.The priority now for Gulf states is to focus on their economies following COVID-19. But security assurances are an important part of that recovery.""A (nuclear) deal is better than no deal, but how can you convince the world -- and investors -- that this is a real deal that can stand the test of time?"" the third source told Reuters.Gulf states hope Washington maintains leverage over Tehran by keeping some sanctions, including those designed to punish foreign actors for supporting terrorism or weapons proliferation. Blinken told a congressional committee hearing that a deal could be used ""as a platform both to look at whether the agreement itself can be lengthened and if necessary strengthened and also to capture"" regional concerns.The Gulf States remain sceptical. UAE envoy to Washington Yousef Al Otaiba said in April he saw no evidence the nuclear deal would become ""a tool where moderates are empowered"" in Iran, which holds presidential elections this month dominated by hardliners.“But we need to live with them in peace,” Otaiba said. “We want non-interference, no missiles, no proxies.”Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Wife of 'El Chapo' to plead guilty to helping him run drug cartel, NY Times says Emma Coronel Aispuro, the wife of Mexican narcotics kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, is expected to plead guilty this week to federal charges of helping him run the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.The Times, citing an unnamed person familiar with the case, reported that Coronel would appear in Federal District Court in Washington on Thursday morning to enter her plea.Her plea agreement will not require her to cooperate with U.S. authorities or provide information about her husband's allies, business partners or relatives, the Times reports.Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment, and the Drug Enforcement Administration had no immediate comment. Lawyers for Coronel did not respond to requests for comment.Coronel, a 31-year-old former beauty queen, was arrested at Washington's Dulles International Airport in February.Prosecutors accused her of working with her husband in running the drug cartel and conspiring in his infamous July 2015 escape from Mexico's Altiplano prison through a mile-long tunnel dug from his cell.After a high-profile trial in a federal court in Brooklyn, New York, Guzman, 63, was convicted in February 2019 of masterminding a multibillion dollar drug enterprise. He was sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years and incarcerated in the federal Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado.Coronel, a dual U.S.-Mexico citizen, married Guzman in 2007 at age 18. The couple has twin daughters.In 2019, Coronel launched a clothing brand in the United States and she also appeared in a U.S. reality show about mafia families.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Twitter Suspends Organization for Announcing They Will Release More Fauci Emails The Informed Consent Action Network was suspended by Twitter on Thursday after they announced that they will soon be publishing more emails from Anthony Fauci. ICAN, an organisation dedicated to increasing informed consent regarding vaccinations, tweeted on Thursday that following the release of thousands of pages from emails from Anthony Fauci that had been revealed through Freedom of Information Act requests from the Washington Post and Buzzfeed, that they would be “dropping 3000 new pages of FOIA’d Fauci emails” that evening, “providing further insight into Anthony Fauci’s actions on Covid, Vaccine Safety, and more.” However, conservative commentator Michelle Malkin later announced that ICAN had been suspended by Twitter for announcing they would release more emails from Fauci. In a screenshot posted by Malkin to the Big Tech site, ICAN’s Twitter had been locked, due to the tweet allegedly “violating their policy on spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19.” My friends at @ICANdecide were suspended by Twitter today for reporting that they have 3,000 additional pages of Fauci's emails they obtained thru FOIA! They'll be posting at https://t.co/2FAmuN6pfZ tonight. Spread the word & help crowdsource review of the emails! pic.twitter.com/BMoNMjMNUv— Michelle Malkin (@michellemalkin) June 3, 2021 Alex Jones breaks down how Dr. Fauci’s fall from grace threatens the entire New World Order system. On their website, Twitter declares that “in order for content related to COVID-19 to be labeled or removed under this policy, it must: advance a claim of fact, expressed in definitive terms; be demonstrably false or misleading, based on widely available, authoritative sources; and be likely to impact public safety or cause serious harm.” Twitter’s further five categories within this policy relating to discussions surrounding the coronavirus outbreak also do not seem to contain any rules which would have resulted in the tweet from ICAN being removed. (BREAKING: President Trump Blasts Fauci For Wuhan ‘Gain of Function’ Research, Devastating Emails In New Statement) National File reached out to Twitter for comment on this story, asking which area of their COVID-19 misinformation policy ICAN violated, but did not receive a response by the time of publication. National File has reported extensively on the contents of Fauci’s emails. One email chain from February of 2020 show that Fauci was not concerned with the new variant of COVID-19, and believed that it would be only as mild as the previous swine flu pandemic from 2009. In another email from the same month, Fauci said that “most transmissions” of virus “occur from someone who is symptomatic” and “not asymptomatic.” However, Fauci publicly touted the idea that asymptomatic spread is “not rare” but in fact common, as the medical experts spread fear about the virus. Yet another email exchange from Fauci shows him promising to pressure then-President Trump to intimidate Florida Governor Ron DeSantis into closing gyms, bars and beaches. Fauci and another physician raged at citizens exercising their individual liberty, with Fauci saying that he screamed during television interviews “2 to 5 times per night” when he saw young people having fun.",0,0
"England Cricketer Gets International Ban For Edgy Tweets He Posted When He Was a Teenager England cricketer Ollie Robinson has now been suspended from all international matches over some edgy tweets he posted when he was a teenager in yet another foul example of cancel culture. “England and Sussex bowler Ollie Robinson has been suspended from all international cricket pending the outcome of a disciplinary investigation following historical tweets he posted in 2012 and 2013,” reports Sky News. The tweets originally posted by Robinson nearly a decade ago when he was 18 can be viewed below. They’re a mixture of offensive words and lads’ banter. Such rhetoric was commonplace on the platform before the world went mad from around 2015 onwards. There's a few things to note about Ollie Robinson's old tweets:1) This will almost certainly happen more and more, as players who have been on social media since their teens make their debuts.2) Anyone can see your public conversations on Twitter. pic.twitter.com/pFbsNiOd1H — Danny (@dafrankland) June 2, 2021 Secretary of State Oliver Dowden responded to the controversy by asserting that cricket authorities had gone too far. “Ollie Robinson’s tweets were offensive and wrong,” tweeted Dowden. “They are also a decade old and written by a teenager. The teenager is now a man and has rightly apologised. The ECB has gone over the top by suspending him and should think again.” Ollie Robinson’s tweets were offensive and wrong. They are also a decade old and written by a teenager. The teenager is now a man and has rightly apologised. The ECB has gone over the top by suspending him and should think again. — Oliver Dowden (@OliverDowden) June 7, 2021 “I don’t even care what he’s said,” remarked another respondent. “Imagine being a young cricket player, fulfilling your lifelong dream of playing for England and some neeky prick scours through your decade-old teenage tweets to find something to be offended by – and you actually get suspended. Cuck culture.” I don’t even care what he’s said.

"AMC stock soars over 20% as Reddit-fueled rally extends to another week Speculative trading activity in AMC Entertainment, the meme stock that has become popular with small investors recently, has pushed the shares of the struggling movie theater chain to double-digit growth. Shares of AMC surged 23% to nearly $57 on Monday, following an 80% rally in the previous week. AMC has gained more than 120% since the beginning of the month, after a wild growth of 160% in May, pushing its 2021 rally to over 2,600%. Last week, the trading frenzy sent AMC stock to an intraday record of $72.62. A speculative buying mania swept Wall Street in January due to a wave of stay-at-home traders who used social media, in this case Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, to coordinate massive short squeezes. As a result, meme stocks like GameStop, a struggling brick-and-mortar video game retailer, and American basic cable television channel AMC catapulted. On Monday, other meme stocks also gained momentum. Bed Bath & Beyond soared 7%, BlackBerry surged over 8%, while GameStop advanced nearly 6%. “It is extremely tempting to short these stocks, but unless you have huge liquid resources, please try to resist the temptation because these prices can go to unimaginable highs before they settle down to a reasonable valuation, and you may have to cover on the high point,” Interactive Brokers chairman Thomas Peterffy told CNBC. “On the long term, stocks always approach their fundamental values, which in this case is much, much lower,” he added. Taking advantage of the rally, AMC sold 20 million shares last week, raising $800 million for the struggling company. CEO Adam Aron said he plans to sell up to 25 million more shares.",0,0

"Study Shows Unexpected Effect of Black Holes Beyond Their Own Galaxies At the heart of almost every sufficiently massive galaxy there is a black hole whose gravitational field, although very intense, affects only a small region around the centre of the galaxy. Even though these objects are thousands of millions of times smaller than their host galaxies our current view is that the Universe can be understood only if the evolution of galaxies is regulated by the activity of these black holes, because without them the observed properties of the galaxies cannot be explained. Theoretical predictions suggest that as these black holes grow they generate sufficient energy to heat up and drive out the gas within galaxies to great distances. Observing and describing the mechanism by which this energy interacts with galaxies and modifies their evolution is therefore a basic question in present day Astrophysics. With this aim in mind, a study led by Ignacio Martín Navarro, a researcher at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC), has gone a step further and has tried to see whether the matter and energy emitted from around these black holes can alter the evolution, not only of the host galaxy, but also of the satellite galaxies around it, at even greater distances. To do this, the team has used the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which allowed them to analyse the properties of the galaxies in thousands of groups and clusters. The conclusions of this study, started during Ignacio’s stay at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics, are published today in Nature magazine. “Surprisingly we found that the satellite galaxies formed more or fewer stars depending on their orientation with respect to the central galaxy”, explains Annalisa Pillepich, researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA, Germany) and co-author of the article. To try to explain this geometrical effect on the properties of the satellite galaxies the researchers used a cosmological simulation of the Universe called Illustris-TNG whose code contains a specific way of handling the interaction between central black holes and their host galaxies. “Just as with the observations, the Illustris-TNG simulation shows a clear modulation of the star formation rate in satellite galaxies depending on their position with respect to the central galaxy”, she adds. This result is doubly important because it gives observational support for the idea that central black holes play an important role in regulating the evolution of galaxies, which is a basic feature of our current understanding of the Universe. Nevertheless, this hypothesis is continually questioned, given the difficulty of measuring the possible effect of the black holes in real galaxies, rather than considering only theoretical implications. These results suggest, then, that there is a particular coupling between the black holes and their galaxies, by which they can expel matter to great distances from the galactic centres, and can even affect the evolution of other nearby galaxies. “So not only can we observe the effects of central black holes on the evolution of galaxies, but our analysis opens the way to understand the details of the interaction”, explains Ignacio Martín Navarro, who is the first author of the article. “This work has been possible due to collaboration between two communities: the observers and the theorists which, in the field of extragalactic Astrophysics, are finding that cosmological simulations are a useful tool to understand how the Universe behaves”, he concludes. An international team of lawyers and medical experts are seeking to charge the CDC, the WHO, and the DAVOS group with crimes against humanity.",0,0

"Meghan and Harry name baby daughter after Queen Elizabeth and Diana Meghan, Britain’s Duchess of Sussex, has given birth to her second child, a girl, whom she and husband Prince Harry have named after Queen Elizabeth and his late mother Princess Diana.Lilibet 'Lili' Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born on Friday at the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in California, with Harry in attendance. The couple's first child, Archie, was born in 2019.The choice of name pays tribute to the queen after a difficult year for the couple, and the wider royal family. Lilibet is a family nickname for the 95-year-old British monarch.Buckingham Palace said the queen, Harry’s father Prince Charles and his brother and wife, Prince William and Kate, were delighted with the news. Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined them in sending his congratulations.William and Kate said via their official Twitter account: ""We are all delighted by the happy news of the arrival of baby Lili. Congratulations to Harry, Meghan and Archie.""Meghan and Harry announced the birth with a statement.""On June 4th, we were blessed with the arrival of our daughter, Lili. She is more than we could have ever imagined, and we remain grateful for the love and prayers we've felt from across the globe,"" they said.""Thank you for your continued kindness and support during this very special time for our family.""Harry and Meghan said Lilibet's middle name was chosen to honour her grandmother, Princess Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997.Both mother and baby - who is eighth in line to the throne - were doing well and were back at home, their press secretary said.The nature of the announcement, almost two days after the birth, reflects the new life the couple have chosen in the United States.When William's wife Kate gave birth to her three children in recent years, she emerged each time alongside her husband from a London hospital just a few hours later to be photographed by the world's media that had camped out in the street.1/6Britain's Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, attend a roundtable discussion on gender equality at Windsor Castle, Windsor, Britain October 25, 2019. Jeremy Selwyn/Pool via ReutersRead MoreCRISISThe birth of Lilibet comes almost a year and a half after Harry and Meghan announced that they intended to step down from their royal roles, plunging the family into crisis.The situation deteriorated sharply in March this year when they gave an explosive interview to U.S. chat show host Oprah Winfrey, accusing one unnamed royal of making a racist remark and saying Meghan's pleas for help when she felt suicidal were ignored.The 39-year-old, whose mother is Black and father is white, said she had been naive before marrying into royalty.Harry, 36, and Meghan live in a secluded $14 million mansion in the celebrity enclave of Montecito, about 80 miles (130 km) north of Los Angeles, which is also home to Winfrey, comedian Ellen DeGeneres, and other celebrities.Harry's last major public appearance was at a VAX Live concert in Los Angeles on May 2. Meghan appeared by video at the concert, which aimed to boost vaccinations worldwide against the coronavirus.Meghan disclosed in a November 2020 essay that she suffered a miscarriage in July 2020.After the interview with Winfrey, Harry made further public criticism of his childhood, creating another public relations problem for the royal family which is led by the queen and 72-year-old Prince Charles.Just last month Harry spoke of the trauma of the loss of his mother and how that was compounded when he had to walk as a 12-year-old behind her coffin in a funeral cortege under the glare of the world's media.The queen, who lost her husband Prince Philip in April after 73 years of marriage, has said she was saddened to learn of the experiences of Harry and Meghan.The couple said they would be taking parental leave from their charity Archewell and have asked people who want to send gifts to support or learn about charities doing work for women and girls, the Archewell website said.The names given to the baby also echo those given to the only daughter of Prince William, Harry’s elder brother, who is called Charlotte Elizabeth Diana.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Biden’s to-do list on foreign trip: Rally allies against COVID, Putin President Joe Biden’s meeting with leaders of the G7 leading industrial economies in an English seaside village this week will usher in a new focus on rallying U.S. allies against common adversaries - the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia and China.New COVID-19 variants and rising death tolls in some countries will loom large during the gathering from Friday to Sunday, alongside climate change, strengthening global supply chains and ensuring the West maintains its technological edge over China, the world's second-largest economy.Biden, a Democrat, vowed to rebuild relations with allies after four rocky years under former President Donald Trump, who pulled Washington out of several multilateral institutions and threatened at one point to quit NATO.""The trip, at its core, will advance the fundamental thrust of Joe Biden's foreign policy to rally the world's democracies to tackle the greatest challenges of our time,"" White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at a briefing on Monday.The gathering will put Biden's ""America is back"" motto to the test, with allies disillusioned during the Trump years looking for tangible, lasting action.TENSIONS WITH RUSSIARussia will be at the forefront of attention at the G7 summit in Cornwall, England, and the days afterward when Biden meets with European leaders and NATO allies in Brussels, before heading to Geneva to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin.U.S. officials are considering sharper action against Russia after two incidents. These are the recent ransomware attack on JBS (JBSS3.SA), the world’s largest meatpacker, by a criminal group likely based in Russia. Also Putin gave financial backing to Belarus after it forced a Ryanair (RYA.I) flight to land so it could arrest a dissident journalist on board are pushing.Biden's meeting with Putin is not a ""reward"" for Putin but instead the most effective way to hear directly from him to understand and manage the differences between Washington and Moscow, Sullivan said.""There is simply a lot we have to work through,"" he said.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg met Biden at the White House on Monday and told reporters afterward that the challenges the allies will confront at their summit will be Russia, China, cyberhacks and climate change, among others.He said a rising China with its military buildup poses a problem because ""they don't share our values.""""We see that in the way they crack down on democratic protests in Hong Kong, how they deal with minorities... and how they coerce neighbors...

He added that the United States will respond if Russia's ""harmful"" activities against Washington continue.Sullivan said Biden spoke with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday and reassured him that he would defend Ukraine's sovereignty in his talks with Putin.According to Sullivan, he also said he hoped the G7 nations would come up with an ""action plan"" to increase their collective defenses against ransomware attacks and deal with the challenges posed by cryptocurrency, which, he said, ""lies at the core of how these ransom transactions are played out.""On the sidelines of a NATO summit in Brussels on June 14, Biden is also expected to meet with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, a crucial session between the sparring NATO allies after Ankara's purchase of Russian defense systems angered Washington and risked driving a wedge within the alliance.Sullivan said the talks with Erdogan would be expansive, covering the eastern Mediterranean, Syria and Afghanistan as well as how to deal with the differences that have arisen between the two countries.He said that Biden and Erdogan, who have known each other for many years now, were looking forward to having a ""business-like"" opportunity to have a broad review of bilateral ties.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Mladic verdict reveals Bosnia's divisions, lack of reconciliation Survivors and relatives of victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre breathed a sigh of relief on Tuesday after U.N. war crimes judges upheld the genocide conviction and life sentence of former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic.""We have been anxious about what will happen for the past month but we are pleased. Thank God it's over,"" said Mida Osmanovic, after watching with other women a public broadcast of the court's verdict at the Srebrenica Memorial Centre.""It gives us some satisfaction but even more distress,"" Osmanovic added, recalling how it made her relive her experiences 26 years earlier.She and other women who lost their male relatives in the massacre considered Europe's worst atrocity since World War Two  walked among the 6,600 white tombstones at Srebrenica cemetery marking the graves of their murdered relatives.""The majority of my family is here,"" Osmanovic said pointing to the tombstones.Mladic, 78, who led Bosnian Serb forces during Bosnia's 1992-95 war, had appealed against his 2017 conviction on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes and his life sentence but the appeals chamber dismissed his appeal and affirmed the sentence of life imprisonment.The verdict caps 25 years of trials at the ad hoc International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which convicted 90 people for the crimes committed in the Bosnian war in which about 100,000 died and 2 million were displaced.But Bosnia's Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats still see the war through opposing lenses.Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik, who is currently chairing Bosnia's tripartite inter-ethnic presidency, criticised the judgement as unfair, saying the ICTY was biased against Serbs and its rulings undermined the trust in international justice.""It's clear to us there is an attempt here to create a myth about genocide in Srebrenica which has never occurred,"" Dodik said.Most Serbs deny that genocide happened and say that Mladic was a Serb defender and a hero.""I think the Hague tribunal has been probably designed from the beginning as a court that would a priori judge one side, that is us ... and I simply do not expect any justice, nothing,"" said Bojan Stojnic, an economist, in Banja Luka, the largest Bosnian Serb city.But Muslim Bosniaks, who suffered the greatest losses in the 1992-95 war, welcomed the ruling.""It is important that his crimes from the last war have been  named before the whole world,"" said Sefik Dzaferovic, the Bosniak member of the country's presidency.

"‘Neither legal nor constitutional’: Virginia teacher who was put on leave for opposing gender pronoun rules SUES school district A Virginia gym teacher has sued his school district after he was placed on administrative leave and put under investigation for speaking out against a rule requiring him to address students by their chosen gender pronouns. Lawyers for Byron ‘Tanner’ Cross, a gym teacher at Leesburg Elementary School, filed suit against the Loudoun County School Board and two of the district’s top executives on Tuesday, alleging that he suffered “content and viewpoint-based retaliation” after openly opposing the pronoun rule at a board meeting last month. According to the lawsuit, Cross was called to meet with his superiors two days after he spoke out and told he was under investigation for “conduct that has had a disruptive impact on the operations” of the school. The core issue of the case, the suit said, is whether public schools can “punish a teacher for objecting… to a proposed policy” that would force them to“express ideas about human nature” that they believe are false – especially at a board meeting, which are meant to host open dialogue about school policies. The meeting included discussion of two transgender-related policy changes – allowing students to use the gender identity and pronouns of their choice, and letting them participate in sports activities based on their gender identity, rather than their biological sex. Cross said his comments were based on his sincerely held religious and philosophical beliefs, as well as his expertise and experience as an educator. “I love all of my students, but I will never lie to them, regardless of the consequences,” Cross said at the meeting. “I’m a teacher, but I serve God first, and I will not affirm that a biological boy can be a girl and vice versa, because it’s against my religion. It’s lying to a child, it’s abuse to a child, and it’s sinning against our god.” A video of his 45-second speech was widely shared on social media and attracted major media coverage. The Alliance for Defending Freedom (ADF), a conservative activist group, is representing Cross in the lawsuit. In a letterpublished on the teacher’s behalf last week, the ADF argued that “public schools have no business compelling teachers to express ideological beliefs that they don’t hold.” “The school favors certain beliefs, and it wants to force Tanner to cry uncle and endorse them as well. That’s neither legal nor constitutional, and neither was the school’s move to place Tanner on leave,” ADF Senior Counsel Tyson Langhofer said. Loudoun County is located about 40 miles northwest of Washington, DC. The school district has been embroiled in ideological controversies previously, including public backlash over a decision in March to “downgrade” the use of Dr. Seuss books during its ‘Read Across America Day,’ citing concerns about “racial undertones” in the popular author’s stories. On Wednesday, one day after the gym teacher’s lawsuit was filed, a group of parents reportedly sued the district in federal court over initiatives that allegedly discriminate against white students based on their race. The district has also stirred controversy for teaching critical race theory (CRT), a doctrine that posits that racism is deeply ingrained in American laws and institutions. Several states are seeking to ban or limit the teaching of CRT over concerns that it is divisive and encourages students to place undue focus on race. Republican-led legislatures in Idaho, Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee and Oklahoma have already passed bills restricting CRT in school curriculums.",0,0

"Peru's Castillo says there is 'hope' as razor-thin margin keeps country on edge Socialist presidential candidate Pedro Castillo said Peruvians are a ""people of hope"" on Sunday, with the country on edge as unofficial vote counts showed him and his conservative election rival separated by the thinnest of margins.A quick count of votes cast in Sunday's election, with a 1% error margin by Ipsos Peru, put Castillo, an elementary school teacher and novice politician, ahead by 0.4 of a percentage point.A previous Ipsos exit poll, with a 3% error margin, put his rival in the run-off election, Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of jailed ex-President Alberto Fujimori, up by 0.6 of a percentage point.By 1 a.m. (0600 GMT), the ONPE electoral agency had published partial official results with 61% of votes counted that put Fujimori first with 52.4% of votes and Castillo second with 47.5%. Authorities however cautioned that this count was predominantly urban, where the conservative candidate has an advantage.""We need to have faith in the people,"" Castillo said. ""Our votes still remain to be counted, the votes of the provinces.""The quick-count results triggered celebrations and cries of ""we won"" from Castillo's supporters in Tacabamba, the Andean town closest to the impoverished village where he was born and raised, which is also where he is waiting for the results.Hundreds gathered in Tacabamba's main square before midnight for a concert with a pro-Castillo presenter telling the crowd: ""yes we can"". The concert appeared to violate an 11 p.m. curfew linked to the coronavirus, which has hit Peru particularly hard.A tight race could lead to days of uncertainty as counts trickle in, and could trigger unrest if disillusioned supporters of either candidate question the results.Castillo had earlier called his supporters onto the streets after an exit poll gave a slender lead to Fujimori. But he has not made any official comment since the quick count put him as the likely winner, and neither has Fujimori.""I ask our people to defend every vote,"" Castillo wrote on Twitter when the early forecast suggested he would lose. ""I call on Peruvian people from all corners of the country to go to the streets in peace to be vigilant in the defence of democracy.""Speaking before the quick count via megaphone from a balcony to crowds in Tacabamba, Castillo appealed for calm.""We must be prudent, the people are wise,"" said the 51-year-old schoolteacher who has vowed to redistribute wealth and rewrite the constitution. ""What we have heard is not official.""Fujimori said she was reserving judgement until the official results. She also appealed for ""prudence, calm and peace from both groups, those who voted and did not vote for us.""CROWDS GATHERReuters witnesses reported a small crowd of people gathering outside the headquarters of Castillo's Peru Libre party in the capital, Lima.Opinion polls up to election day had indicated a statistical dead heat, with Fujimori, who had earlier trailed Castillo, pulling slightly ahead at the end of campaigning.  read more Polls showed urban and higher-income citizens prefer Fujimori, while the rural poor largely support Castillo.Both candidates have pledged vastly different remedies for rescuing Peru from the economic doldrums brought on by the COVID-19 crisis, which has seen it lead the world in per capital deaths.Fujimori, a 46-year-old who has tilted at the presidency twice before, has pledged to follow the free-market model and maintain economic stability in the world’s second-largest copper producer.Castillo, the son of peasant farmers, has promised to redraft the constitution to strengthen the role of the state, take a larger portion of profits from mining firms and nationalize key industries.Voting in the Lima district of Surco on Sunday afternoon, Fujimori noted a handful of allegations of doctored voting papers discovered in the capital and the country´s interior.""We know that there have been incidents today. We hope that the electoral bodies will take action on the matter and sanctions will be issued accordingly,"" she said. ""I also expect our party officials to be on their guard.""In Lima, voters made their way to polling stations by bike, roller skates and on foot to traffic jams that built up as the day progressed.Among those casting their vote in Lima was Luis Pizango, who said that for him, ""transparency"" was key.""May Peru win for the good of all Peruvians,"" he said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Video: A Vindicated Rand Paul Decimates Fauci Over Emails Senator Rand Paul, who has constantly challenged the contradictory and unscientific statements of Dr Fauci, as well as pointing out Fauci’s involvement in funding gain of function research with coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, appeared vindicated in an interview Thursday following disturbing revelations from released emails, which Paul urged should be the final nail in Fauci’s coffin. Speaking to Laura Ingraham, Paul asserted that “The emails paint a disturbing picture, a disturbing picture of Dr. Fauci, from the very beginning, worrying that he had been funding gain-of-function research. He knows it to this day, but hasn’t admitted it.” The Senator also urged that Fauci’s involvement has not been adequately investigated because in the eyes of Democrats “he could do no wrong”. Are Fauci's days numbered? pic.twitter.com/bszGs7aRxL— Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) June 3, 2021 Paul pointed out that Fauci was denying that there was even any funding for gain of function research at the Wuhan lab just a few weeks back, a claim which is totally contradicted by his own emails in which he discusses it. “In his e-mail, within the topic line, he says ‘acquire of perform research.’ He was admitting it to his non-public underlings seven to eight months in the past,” Paul emphasised. The Senator also pointed to the email from Dr. Peter Daszak, President of the EcoHealth Alliance, a group that directly funded the Wuhan lab gain of function research, thanking Fauci for not giving credence to the lab leak theory. Ingraham asked Paul if Fauci could face felony culpability, to which the Senator replied “At the very least, there is ethical culpability,” and Fauci should be fired from his government roles.

"Iraq releases Iran-aligned commander arrested on terror charges Iraq has released an Iran-aligned militia commander arrested in May on terrorism-related charges after authorities found insufficient evidence against him, in the latest blow to government attempts to rein in armed groups.Security forces arrested Qasim Muslih, who operates mostly in Iraq's western Anbar province and is from the southern holy city of Kerbala, on May 26. His arrest and subsequent release show how the Iraqi government is struggling to deal with militias ideologically aligned with Iran which are accused of rocket fire against U.S. forces and of involvement in killing peaceful pro-democracy activists.Hours after Muslih's release, two separate rocket attacks hit near U.S. forces and contractors at the Baghdad International Airport compound and an air base north of the Iraqi capital. There was no claim for the attacks.Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi has placed himself publicly in opposition to Iran-backed militias and parties but has fallen short on pledges to curb anti-U.S. attacks and hold killers of protesters to account.Muslih's arrest was seen as the latest major attempt to rein in their power. His release without prosecution is a blow to those efforts and one of a number of unsuccessful attempts to crack down on armed groups.The military had said the charges against him were terrorism-related but did not give details.Security officials told Reuters at the time of the arrest that it was linked to attacks on U.S. forces stationed in Iraq. Some media and analysts said it was because of Muslih's alleged involvement in killing activists.Kadhimi's two most high-profile moves against Iran-backed factions - the arrest of Muslih in May and the detention in June 2020 of fighters allegedly involved in rocket fire against U.S. targets - have each resulted in no prosecutions and all those arrested being released.On both occasions, heavily armed militiamen have stormed Baghdad's fortified Green Zone, where foreign embassies and government buildings are located, threatening the prime minister.Muslih commands the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) in Anbar province and leads his own faction within the organization.The PMF is Iraq's state paramilitary grouping that includes mostly Shi'ite Muslim factions and is dominated by Iran-backed groups. Muslih is seen by Western and some Iraqi officials as being aligned with Iran.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Harris says Mexico talks ‘candid,’ pledges investment to stem migration U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris told Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador that she saw him as a partner in tackling migration as they agreed on Tuesday to deepen economic ties and invest to improve conditions in Central America.The administration of President Joe Biden has been struggling with the number of migrant children and families arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, mainly from Central America, and Biden has tasked Harris with trying to solve the issue.On her first trip abroad since taking office, Harris said talks with Lopez Obrador were “candid,” covering topics, including security, vaccines, the pandemic and the spread of the drug fentanyl. She also said she would visit the U.S.-Mexico border.""We made clear that the United States considers Mexico to be a partner on many of these issues,"" Harris told reporters after the meetings, hailing a ""new era"" of bilateral relations. Lopez Obrador called the encounter ""pleasant and beneficial.""Harris and Lopez Obrador spent more than an hour in private meetings, as well as in broader talks, a White House aide said.Much of the focus was on improving livelihoods, and the United States pledged an additional $130 million over three years to support Mexican worker rights along with a goal of creating $250 million in investment and sales in southern Mexico, it said in a vaguely worded statement.The two sides will hold a meeting known as a high-level economic dialogue in September to look at ways to promote investment and make the most of a new trade deal, statements from both governments said.A similar meeting will also be held on security, and a task force will work on breaking up people smuggling rings.Since Biden took office in January, the number of migrants taken into custody per month at the border has risen to the highest levels in 20 years.Lopez Obrador, who built a working relationship with Donald Trump despite the former U.S. president's economic threats and insults against Mexico over migration, said his government was very interested in maintaining good relations with Washington.1/12U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is greeted by officials as she disembarks from Air Force Two upon arrival at Benito Juarez International Airport in Mexico City, Mexico, for her first international trip as Vice President to Guatemala and Mexico, June 7, 2021.

Some members of the Biden administration want Mexico to do more.The vice president, who has faced repeated questions from Republican critics about why she has not visited the border, said she “would go.” MEXICO PARTNERSHIPThe administration sees Mexico as an important partner both on slowing the flow of migrants and on working on development in Central America, where relations between national governments and Washington are increasingly fraught.Washington and Mexico largely agree they need to attack underlying causes of poverty and violence to stem migration from Central America's ""Northern Triangle"" - El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras.Before the meeting, Harris and Lopez Obrador witnessed the official signing of a memorandum of understanding to ""co-create and co-manage"" a program to deliver and measure aid to the region. The aim was to address the lack of economic opportunities in northern Central America, with a focus on farm development and youth programs, a U.S. statement said.Harris has previously promised an additional $310 million in aid to soothe the impact of the pandemic and hurricanes last year in Central America.Mexico has implemented cash-for-tree-planting and youth unemployment benefit programs to El Salvador and Honduras on a limited scale and plans to add Guatemala, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Tuesday before the Harris meeting. It was not clear if the U.S. would participate in these cash transfer projects.In Mexico’s poor southern region bordering Guatemala, U.S. agencies will support coffee, cocoa and eco-tourism and infrastructure initiatives, as well as supporting affordable housing and mortgages, the U.S. statement said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1

Commentators have also taken issue with a WHO official with ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology praising Fauci for dismissing the theory that the virus was man-made. While the GOP called for Fauci to either step down or be fired for his flip-flopping on a number of issues, such as the mask mandate, as well as the alleged government funding of gain-of-function research, the White House has stood firmly behind him.

"Mexican president vows focus on poor after mixed election results Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday vowed to double down on helping the poor after a mid-term election that clipped his wings in Congress with a reduced majority but handed a clutch of new state governments to his candidates.A preliminary estimate by the National Electoral Institute (INE) after Sunday's elections put Lopez Obrador's ruling coalition on course to win between 265 and 292 of the 500 lower-house seats, short of the two-thirds majority he managed to muster in the first half of his term.Since taking office in 2018, Lopez Obrador has redirected the federal budget to welfare programs and building infrastructure including a refinery and a train.Asked how he would respond to the outcome of the elections he said he was committed to doing more for the poor.""For me it's a source of pride that the humblest and poorest are the ones who most support the program of transformation,"" he said.Lopez Obrador thanked voters for ensuring his political project would still have a majority in the lower house, and with it, the control of the budget.However, the lower-house losses are likely to curb his scope to pursue constitutional changes to bolster his drive to tighten state control of the energy sector.The outcome was roughly in line with final opinion polls, which showed the race tightening after a fatal metro accident in Mexico City and accusations that Lopez Obrador had intervened excessively in the campaign.Investors saw the election as positive for Mexico's risk outlook. The peso gained as much as 1.1% to 19.7382 to the dollar to a three-week high. Lopez Obrador has attacked his predecessors as corrupt and in hock to corporate interests who fomented poverty, inequality and violence. But he has struggled to deliver on pledges to combat gang violence and lift anemic growth.Capitalizing on discontent over his record, the opposition made gains in Mexico City, provisional results showed.The capital has been a bastion for Lopez Obrador since he rose to national prominence as mayor from 2000 to 2005.

According to INE projections, it will win between 190 and 203.The new lower house will be seated in September.MORENA and its allies won 42.5% of votes cast for the lower house, according to a preliminary count of 89% of ballots. The main opposition alliance was slightly behind on 40.0%.MORENA's individual tally was far ahead of its nearest rival, giving it a clear advantage in picking up seats from the 300 awarded under a first-past-the-post system. The remaining 200 house seats are divvied up via proportional representation.To defend its majority, MORENA will rely on votes from the Labor Party (PT) and the Green Party, a political grouping that has proven adept at forging alliances with whoever is in power.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"New dinosaur species discovered in Australia, one of world's biggest Scientists have confirmed the discovery of a new dinosaur species in Australia, one of the largest found in the world, more than a decade after cattle farmers first uncovered bones of the animal.The plant-eating sauropod lived in the Cretaceous period between 92 million and 96 million years ago when Australia was attached to Antartica, according to a research paper published on Monday.Paleontologists estimated the dinosaur reached a height of 5-6.5 metres at the hip and 25-30 metres in length, making it as long as a basketball court and as tall as a two storey building.That makes the new species the largest dinosaur ever found in Australia and puts it in the top five in the world, joining an elite group of titanosaurs previously only discovered in South America.""Discoveries like this are just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Queensland Museum curator and palaeontologist Scott Hocknull.Paleontologists have named the sauropod ""Australotitan cooperensis"", combining ""southern titan"" with the name of a creek near where the first of the creature's bones were found in 2006 on a cattle farming property in Eromanga in Queensland state.The confirmation of the new species marks a seventeen-year long journey to first unearth and then compare the bones of ""Cooper"", as the dinosaur is more informally known, to other finds.1/3Dr. Scott Hocknull and Robyn Mackenzie pose with a 3D reconstruction and the humerus bone of ""Cooper,"" a new species of dinosaur discovered in Queensland and recognised as the largest ever found in Australia, in this undated handout image made available to Reuters on June 8, 2021 in Eromanga, Australia.

In Brussels, Belgium, police used drones fitted with loudspeakers to bark orders to people to “stay at home.” Police drones are being used in Brussels to warn the public that lockdown is in force, and that social distancing regulations must be adhered to.

"Economist Rips Media for Downplaying Inflation Average Americans are worried about inflation, but the mainstream financial media doesn’t think they should be. Even though inflation is a hot topic, the conversation seems to primarily center around the notion that inflation is overblown. In his podcast, Peter explains why this mainstream media spin downplaying inflation is dead wrong. “Everybody is trying to reassure the public, investors that there really is no inflation, that it’s all transitory like the Fed says, and that those of us who are warning about inflation, well, we’re the same chicken littles who warned about inflation following the 2008 financial crisis when the Fed embarked on quantitative easing and zero percent interest rates for the first time.” Since inflation never turned out to be a problem after ’08, the mainstream reasons it won’t be a problem now. Peter wasn’t the only person worried about inflation in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Gold went up to $1,900 an ounce in 2011, driven by fears about the consequences of all the money printing. “The fact that the Fed was able to convince everybody that there was no inflation, and the government was able to fool everybody with their highly manipulated consumer price numbers, the people who were concerned about inflation were discredited, even though we have had quite a bit of inflation below the surface.” Peter said he thinks consumer prices rose more in the aftermath of the Great Recession than official government numbers indicate, and he noted that inflation doesn’t only manifest itself in rising consumer prices. It shows up in asset prices — in an overvalued stock market and spiking real estate prices. It also manifests itself in economic imbalances such as the trade deficit and budget deficits. “So, inflation has, in fact, been here. It’s done a lot of damage beneath the surface.” But Peter concedes that inflation didn’t show up in consumer prices in the way he and others thought it would. “I still think those concerns are going to be borne out by reality. It’s just that the lag is going to be many, many years longer than I or other people originally expected.” Peter said those people taking comfort in the fact that they think everybody who was warning about inflation were wrong and the Fed’s policy has been vindicated are the ones who are dead wrong. “The policy was an abysmal failure, which is why the Fed has had to repeat it so many times. But now it really seems obvious that all of those inflation chickens are finally coming home to roost, and people like me are about to get vindicated. But the mainstream still is oblivious to this reality despite all of the overwhelming evidence that they can now see that inflation is creating its ugly head in a big way.” Peter noted the price of oil, which topped $70 a barrel for the first time since the pandemic. In fact, oil prices are now higher than they were before the initial COVID collapse. More significant than the $70 handle is where the future price will likely be. There is very little upside resistance. Peter said he thinks the next area of significant resistance will be around $100 a barrel. He thinks we could see that price by the end of the year. “That is a huge increase in oil prices from where the year began and from where they were at their low point. … The trajectory here is very significant. You can’t ignore it. But more importantly, where are oil prices likely to be in 2022, because if you look at this chart, it seems to me we are going to test the record highs just below $150 a barrel that were set back in the summer of 2008. That was just before the ’08 financial crisis, and that’s what really turned the whole commodity bull market.” The reason oil came down off those highs was a big rally in the dollar. “I think we’re going to revisit that $150 price level in 2022 in conjunction with a big decline in the dollar. I think the dollar is going to revisit the lows it established in the summer of 2008, most likely, I think, sometime in 2022. So, a big rise in oil prices is going to coincide with a big dump in the dollar. Of course, it’s not just going to be oil prices that are going up. It’s going to be all sorts of commodities and consumer prices.” But right now, the financial media is overlooking the significance of rising oil prices. Keep in mind, the price of oil rising isn’t causing inflation. It is the result of inflation. But the price of oil factors into a lot of other prices. In fact, the cost of all production inputs is going up – including labor. “So, there is significant evidence of inflation right now if you just look at what’s happening to consumer prices. Yet the media continues to downplay the significance of what we’re seeing.” The financial media points to the rising stock market and the bond market as evidence that there’s nothing to worry about. They argue that the bond market, in particular, isn’t showing any inflation premium. “Well, the bond market is completely broken. It is not the same type of reliable indicator of inflation fears that it once was when we had a free market in bonds. The bond market has been totally corrupted by central bankers, in particular, the Fed. Also, foreign central banks. So, it is not reliable.” As proof, just look at the yield on the 10-year Treasury. Figuring in taxes, it is factoring in less than 1% inflation per year. This is absurd even with an optimistic eye. The 30-year Treasury yield is even more out of whack. Even at a 2% inflation rate, a 30-year bond should be yielding 4 to 5%. We’re not even close to that level. If you look at the 30-year bond as an inflation gauge, you would assume that inflation in the US is going to run under 1% for the next 30 years. “The fact that the yields are so low is proof that you can’t place any stock in anything you’re seeing in this bond market. It is completely broken. … It is completely corrupted by governments and central banks printing money, buying bonds. There may be some other leverged speculators in there that have no intention of holding these bonds to maturity. There’s some trading going on. So, forget about it. You can’t take any comfort in the bond market. It has been completely destroyed of any type of reliability.” The financial media also points to the stock market, arguing that if investors were worried about inflation, it would be selling off. “I think that is completely wrong. In fact, I think investors are buying stocks because they’re worried about inflation. They’re trying to find a way to preserve their wealth and they want to buy real assets. And so, they’re buying stocks.” This is why we’ve seen this pivot from momentum stocks to value stocks. Value stocks provide a better inflation hedge. “People who are pointing to the record highs in the stock market as some indication that investors aren’t worried about inflation — they have it completely backward. It’s because investors are worried about inflation that they are buying stocks.” An international team of lawyers and medical experts are seeking to charge the CDC, the WHO, and the DAVOS group with crimes against humanity.",0,0
"Swiss to vote on whether to become first European nation to ban synthetic pesticides Switzerland could become the first European country to ban artificial pesticides in a June 13 referendum which backers of the initiative hope will trigger similar prohibitions elsewhere.Globally, only Bhutan has a complete ban on synthetic pesticides, according to supporters aiming to outlaw the use of products made by agro-chemical giants such as Switzerland's Syngenta and Germany's Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and BASF (BASFn.DE).Supporters of the ban say the artificial products cause serious health problems and reduce biodiversity. Manufacturers say their pesticides are rigorously tested and regulated, can be used safely and crop yields would slump without them.Another initiative to be voted on the same day aims to improve the quality of Switzerland's drinking water and food by stopping direct subsidies to farmers who use artificial pesticides and antibiotics in livestock.Switzerland has been starkly divided by an unusually bitter debate over the initiatives and the votes look set to be close. A recent Tamedia poll showed 48% of voters favoured the drinking water initiative and 49% supported the pesticide ban.If adopted, the proposals give farmers up to 10 years to make the transition, which would allow Switzerland to become a pioneer in organic food as well as an example to the rest of the world, Swiss wine maker Roland Lenz said.""Clean water, one of the foundations of life, is endangered,"" said Lenz, a 51-year-old organic farmer, whose vineyard is surrounded by farmers opposing the initiative.Syngenta, which is headquartered in Switzerland and owned by China National Chemical Corporation, opposes both initiatives, saying a ban would reduce agricultural yields by up to 40%.""The consequences of not using them are clear: fewer regional products, higher prices, and more imports. This is not in the interest of consumers, nor is it in the interest of the environment,"" a Syngenta spokesman said.LIFE UNDER SIEGEThe clean water initiative also wants farmers to stop using imported animal feed, to restrict the numbers of cows, pigs and chickens in Switzerland along with the manure they produce that can pollute drinking water.""People have been sold a romantic image of farming in Switzerland, which is far removed from reality,"" said Pascal Scheiwiller, a backer of the clean water campaign, which estimates 1 million Swiss people drink contaminated water.The Swiss Farmers Union said many of its members feel their way of life is under siege.""A lot of people in cities think if they have two tomatoes growing on the balcony of their apartment they understand farming,"" said Martin Haab, president of the Zurich Farmers Association.""I look back 200 years ago when we couldn't protect our plants and animals, and we had hunger in Switzerland and all over Europe,"" said Haab.Martin's son Dominic, who runs a dairy farm outside Zurich, said the consequences for the rural economy would be brutal, with local businesses also being hit by a fall in animal numbers to comply with the fodder restrictions.Wine maker Lenz, however, said to continue using pesticides was ""sheer lunacy"", especially when it was possible to use methods such as growing fruit with thicker skins to make them fungus resistant.“With a ‘Yes’ vote on both initiatives, we will finally move from the chemical age back to the organic age,” he said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1

"Drug kingpin El Chapo's wife to plead guilty to U.S. charges The wife of Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, Emma Coronel Aispuro, is expected to plead guilty on Thursday in federal court in Washington, where she has been accused of helping her husband run the Sinaloa cartel of smugglers, court records show.Coronel, who prosecutors say played a key role in Guzman's 2015 escape from a Mexican prison, is slated to appear for a virtual hearing at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT) before U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras.Reuters could not immediately determine what charges she will plead guilty to, and there was no additional information on the court docket. If convicted on all charges she faces, she could be sentenced to as long as life in prison and fined up to $10 million.Attorneys for Coronel could not be immediately reached.The 31-year-old former beauty queen was arrested in February on allegations that she relayed messages to help Guzman conduct drug trafficking from 2012 to early 2014, and continued delivering messages while visiting him in a Mexican prison following his February 2014 arrest.The FBI in court documents said Coronel, who was born in California and holds both U.S. and Mexican citizenship, and members of her family were deeply involved in the cartel's trafficking activities.Prosecutors have also said she conspired in Guzman's famous July 2015 escape from the Altiplano prison in Mexico through a mile-long (1.6 km-long) tunnel dug from his cell, and began plotting another escape following his January 2016 capture by Mexican authorities.1/2Emma Coronel Aispuro, the wife of Joaquin Guzman, the Mexican drug lord known as ""El Chapo"", exits the Brooklyn Federal Courthouse, during the trial of Guzman in the Brooklyn borough of New York, U.S., February 11, 2019.

"Carbon dioxide in the air at highest level since measurements began Despite a massive reduction in commuting and in many commercial activities during the early months of the pandemic, the amount of carbon in Earth's atmosphere in May reached its highest level in modern history, a global indicator released on Monday showed.Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, said the findings, based on the amount of carbon dioxide in the air at NOAA's weather station on Mauna Loa in Hawaii, was the highest since measurements began 63 years ago.The measurement, called the Keeling Curve after Charles David Keeling, the scientist who began tracking carbon dioxide there in 1958, is a global benchmark for atmospheric carbon levels.Instruments perched on NOAA's mountaintop observatory recorded carbon dioxide at about 419 parts per million last month, more than the 417 parts per million in May 2020.Because carbon dioxide is a key driver of climate change, the findings show that reducing the use of fossil fuels, deforestation and other practices that lead to carbon emissions must be a top priority to avoid catastrophic consequences, Pieter Tans, a scientist with NOAA's Global Monitoring Laboratory, said in a report on the emissions.“We are adding roughly 40 billion metric tons of CO2 pollution to the atmosphere per year,” Tans wrote. “That is a mountain of carbon that we dig up out of the Earth, burn, and release into the atmosphere as CO2 - year after year.""The amount of carbon in the air now is as much as it was about 4 million years ago, a time when sea level was 78 feet (24 meters) higher than it is today and the average temperature was 7 degrees Fahrenheit higher than it was before the Industrial Revolution, the report said.Despite the pandemic lockdown, scientists were not able to see a drop in the overall amount of carbon in the atmosphere  partly because of wildfires, which also release carbon, as well as the natural behavior of carbon in the atmosphere, the report said.The carbon dioxide levels measured were not affected by the eruption of Hawaiian volcanoes, Tans said, adding the station is situated far enough from active volcanoes that measurements are not distorted, and occasional plumes of carbon dioxide are removed from the data.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"NASA’s Juno to Get a Close Look at Jupiter’s Moon Ganymede The first of the gas-giant orbiter’s back-to-back flybys will provide a close encounter with the massive moon after over 20 years. On Monday, June 7, at 1:35 p.m. EDT (10:35 a.m. PDT), NASA’s Juno spacecraft will come within 645 miles (1,038 kilometers) of the surface of Jupiter’s largest moon, Ganymede. The flyby will be the closest a spacecraft has come to the solar system’s largest natural satellite since NASA’s Galileo spacecraft made its penultimate close approach back on May 20, 2000. Along with striking imagery, the solar-powered spacecraft’s flyby will yield insights into the moon’s composition, ionosphere, magnetosphere, and ice shell. Juno’s measurements of the radiation environment near the moon will also benefit future missions to the Jovian system. Ganymede is bigger than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the solar system with its own magnetosphere – a bubble-shaped region of charged particles surrounding the celestial body. “Juno carries a suite of sensitive instruments capable of seeing Ganymede in ways never before possible,” said Juno Principal Investigator Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. “By flying so close, we will bring the exploration of Ganymede into the 21st century, both complementing future missions with our unique sensors and helping prepare for the next generation of missions to the Jovian system – NASA’s Europa Clipper and ESA’s [European Space Agency’s] JUpiter ICy moons Explorer [JUICE] mission.” Juno’s science instruments will begin collecting data about three hours before the spacecraft’s closest approach. Along with the Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) and Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) instruments, Juno’s Microwave Radiometer’s (MWR) will peer into Ganymede’s water-ice crust, obtaining data on its composition and temperature. “Ganymede’s ice shell has some light and dark regions, suggesting that some areas may be pure ice while other areas contain dirty ice,” said Bolton. “MWR will provide the first in-depth investigation of how the composition and structure of the ice varies with depth, leading to a better understanding of how the ice shell forms and the ongoing processes that resurface the ice over time.” The results will complement those from ESA’s forthcoming JUICE mission, which will look at the ice using radar at different wavelengths when it becomes the first spacecraft to orbit a moon other than Earth’s Moon in 2032. Signals from Juno’s X-band and Ka-band radio wavelengths will be used to perform a radio occultation experiment to probe the moon’s tenuous ionosphere (the outer layer of an atmosphere where gases are excited by solar radiation to form ions, which have an electrical charge). “As Juno passes behind Ganymede, radio signals will pass through Ganymede’s ionosphere, causing small changes in the frequency that should be picked up by two antennas at the Deep Space Network’s Canberra complex in Australia,” said Dustin Buccino, a signal analysis engineer for the Juno mission at JPL. “If we can measure this change, we might be able to understand the connection between Ganymede’s ionosphere, its intrinsic magnetic field, and Jupiter’s magnetosphere.” Three Cameras, Two Jobs Normally, Juno’s Stellar Reference Unit (SRU) navigation camera is tasked with helping keep the Jupiter orbiter on course, but during the flyby it will do double duty. Along with its navigation duties, the camera – which is well shielded against radiation that could otherwise adversely affect it – will gather information on the high-energy radiation environment in the region near Ganymede by collecting a special set of images. “The signatures from penetrating high-energy particles in Jupiter’s extreme radiation environment appear as dots, squiggles, and streaks in the images – like static on a television screen. We extract these radiation-induced noise signatures from SRU images to obtain diagnostic snapshots of the radiation levels encountered by Juno,” said Heidi Becker, Juno’s radiation monitoring lead at JPL. Meanwhile, the Advanced Stellar Compass camera, built at the Technical University of Denmark, will count very energetic electrons that penetrate its shielding with a measurement every quarter of a second. Also being enlisted is the JunoCam imager. Conceived to bring the excitement and beauty of Jupiter exploration to the public, the camera has provided an abundance of useful science as well during the mission’s almost five-year tenure at Jupiter. For the Ganymede flyby, JunoCam will collect images at a resolution equivalent to the best from Voyager and Galileo. The Juno science team will scour the images, comparing them to those from previous missions, looking for changes in surface features that might have occurred over four-plus decades. Any changes to crater distribution on the surface could help astronomers better understand the current population of objects that impact moons in the outer solar system. Due to the speed of the flyby, the icy moon will – from JunoCam’s viewpoint – go from being a point of light to a viewable disk then back to a point of light in about 25 minutes. So that’s just enough time for five images. “Things usually happen pretty quick in the world of flybys, and we have two back-to-back next week. So literally every second counts,” said Juno Mission Manager Matt Johnson of JPL. “On Monday, we are going to race past Ganymede at almost 12 miles per second (19 kilometers per second). Less than 24 hours later we’re performing our 33rd science pass of Jupiter – screaming low over the cloud tops, at about 36 miles per second (58 kilometers per second). It is going to be a wild ride.” More About the Mission JPL, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, California, manages the Juno mission for the principal investigator, Scott J. Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio.

"Belarus introduces prison sentences for taking part in protests Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Tuesday signed into law prison sentences for people taking part in protests or insulting state officials, part of an unprecedented crackdown by the veteran leader since a disputed election last year.In a series of amendments to the criminal code, Lukashenko also for the first time introduced a four-year prison sentence for people found guilty of spreading false information that discredits the state.The Russian-backed president also introduced tougher penalties for resisting the police and using protest symbols.Under the new law, anyone who has been detained at least twice for taking part in a protest, or insulted a government official, faces up to three years in prison, whereas previously they were subjected to detentions or fines.""This naturally worsens the situation in the field of civil and political rights,"" said Valentin Stefanovich of the Viasna-96 human rights group.

"Indian experts urge faster inoculations ahead of free COVID-19 shots Indian officials and health experts welcomed a federal government plan to give free COVID-19 shots to all adults as a step in the right direction on Tuesday, but cautioned that vaccinations must be accelerated to prevent new surges in infections.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday the federal government would take over the inoculation programme from Indian states and offer free doses to everyone over the age of 18. His announcement on national television followed weeks of criticism of a vaccine rollout that has covered fewer than 5% of India's estimated adult population of 950 million.

"How China's vaccine diplomacy brought bosom buddy Cambodia even closer Almost one in every five Cambodians has already received a dose of anti-coronavirus vaccine, catapulting the country well past wealthier, bigger Southeast Asian neighbours. Like the doses, the success story is labelled 'Made in China'.Already one of China's closest allies, Cambodia kickstarted inoculations with a bigger donation of vaccines from China than any other country in the region - in addition to Chinese vaccines it had already bought itself.Cambodia's early progress reflects Beijing's vaccine diplomacy in a region where competition with U.S. influence is intense, but has increased concerns among some Cambodians over the closeness of those ties. The United States announced its first major donations to Asia last week.""The question is asked whether Cambodia is too dependent on China,"" authoritarian Prime Minister Hun Sen said in a recent speech. ""If I don't rely on China, whom should I rely on? Without the donations and sales of vaccines from China, we would not have vaccinated the Cambodian people.""Only the wealthy city state of Singapore has made more rapid progress in Southeast Asia relative to population.Some 16% of Cambodia's 16 million people have had at least one vaccine dose, according to official numbers. Close behind are tiny Brunei and then Laos, another state with very close links to Beijing.Much bigger Malaysia and Indonesia had only managed 7.6% and 6.6% respectively, with Thailand on 4.6% and the Philippines 4.2%, according to the latest official data.In Vietnam, where anti-China feeling runs strong, little more than 1% of the population had been covered. Hanoi only approved a Chinese vaccine for emergency use on June 4.""The Cambodian vaccination campaign depends on the use of Chinese vaccines, the road that Hanoi is not willing to take,"" said Nguyen Khac Giang, a PhD candidate at Victoria University of Wellington.'HOLDING HANDS'As Cambodia faced its worst surge of the virus last month, China pledged full support ""which not only embodies the two sides' special friendship but China's responsibility for the China-Cambodia community of a shared future"", China's Global Times quoted foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian as saying.Over 90% of the vaccines Cambodia has used so far are Chinese - from donations totalling 1.7 million doses as of late April, and purchases of 4 million doses from Chinese drugmaker Sinovac. The only other vaccines used have been from the global COVAX programme, set up to assist inoculation in less wealthy countries.""China is the first country to give aid to Cambodia, they let Cambodians get vaccinated and the quality is good,"" said 19-year-old Sinopharm-vaccinated waiter Song Sok Putheara.But he added: ""They help us too much and too often, like they are holding hands and not letting us go.""Still, China's ties with Cambodia have suited both governments.China stepped up aid and investment even as Hun Sen was condemned by Western countries for alleged human rights abuses and the crushing of his political opposition.Meanwhile Cambodia has backed China's position on its extensive claims in the South China Sea against Southeast Asian rivals. It also has growing defence ties - while denying U.S. accusations it is becoming a forward base for China's People's Liberation Army.""Vaccines have become an act of political diplomacy to make and increase Chinese influence in the region, in the world and in Cambodia,"" said Pa Chanroeun, president of the Cambodian Institute for Democracy thinktank.'DEVELOP TRUST'Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, Chinese vaccine donations have not been as generous as in Cambodia, but purchased Chinese vaccines have been vital in Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.Most of the tens of millions of vaccine doses in Indonesia have been made by Chinese companies.The fact that China made its vaccines available on a large scale created a lot of goodwill, said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a foreign policy expert at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences.While it wouldn't erase strains such as those over the South China Sea, it would make a difference, she said.""If you develop co-operation in low security-sensitive areas and then you develop trust then that prevents conflict. I think that's also the case with China and Indonesia,"" she said.Meanwhile the U.S. programme vaccine donation to Asia is now under way.So far, a total of 7 million shots are to be shared across a region of over 2.5 billion people.

"Why Corporate Lobbyists and Special Interest Groups Won’t Go Away Throughout much of human history, a political ruler was often considered to be only as good as his ability to distribute gifts, booty, and other material rewards to his most valuable and loyal servants. In the “barbarian” days of northern Europe, military men expected their kings to lead them to booty, and to distribute gifts to the best fighters after the battle was won. In later ages, the more powerful kings could dole out titles of nobility, lands to faithful servants, and bureaucratic offices with hefty salaries to trusted advisors. In exchange for all this largesse, subjects could offer their personal loyalty, but they could also offer military services, special know-how, and help in drumming up additional support for the crown. Those kings who could distribute the most gifts could often expect the most loyalty and assistance from others. After all, here was a king who could make you rich. Offering “help” to the rich and powerful has often come with many potential benefits. Few go to kings anymore for gifts of swords and gold. But the game has not fundamentally changed. In the modern world, the kings have largely been replaced by faceless bureaucratic regimes composed of countless agencies, commissions, panels, committees, and executive officers. Regime executives can still dole out jobs to loyalists and favored interest groups. Policymakers can rewrite laws and regulations to favor those who can offer the regime something in return. For ordinary people, who don’t get many favors from the regime, there is a big downside in this game. The riches go to the politically powerful, and not to those who work the hardest or are the most productive. Wealth is continually redistributed through a process of state coercion rather than through the voluntary market process. As a result, wealth flows into industries and firms on the basis of how much they’re valued by policymakers. Politicians know this is a problem, so they try to play both sides. We hear from politicians every election cycle about getting “big money” out of politics. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders both made this notion central to their presidential campaigns. But what can really be done about it? People like Sanders, not surprisingly, think the answer is in more government regulation. In practice, however, the solution lies only in reducing the power and wealth of the regime. Why We Have Pressure Groups and Lobbyists Nowadays, in order to secure wealth and favors from the regime, pressure groups hire lobbyists and public relations consultants. Powerful corporations go to the regime seeking tax breaks, subsidies, and anticompetitive regulations. Today we call this “rent seeking” (from an old definition of the word “rent” once favored by economists). These rent-seeking firms want access to the treasure trove of wealth hoarded by the regime. And why shouldn’t these corporate interests and pressure groups seek favors? In the United States, the federal government in 2020 controlled a budget of more than 6 trillion dollars. Moreover, the same government also has control over countless regulations and statutes that can make or break one’s business or household budget. It’s easy to figure out where to go if one’s looking to protect or enhance one’s livelihood. Indeed, rent seeking by pressure groups and corporations is the natural outcome in any polity where the regime controls immense amounts of wealth. Reducing the Size and Power of the State The answer to all of this is simple—although certainly not easy to accomplish. First, if we want less rent seeking, we must reduce the benefits of rent seeking in the first place. This means stripping the state of much of its ability to dole out rewards to those seeking special favors. It means reducing the size of the state and its coffers overall. It means stripping federal policymakers of their power to regulate the economy for the benefit of some at the expense of others. Without these powers and funds, the federal government suddenly becomes a much less fruitful target for lobbying, bribes, and other means of obtaining special favors. There are, of course, many obstacles to reductions in a regime’s size and scope in terms of the wealth it controls. Political scientists have demonstrated this for years with theories like the so-called iron triangle, which shows how interest groups, legislators, and bureaucrats work together to increase or safeguard the regime’s control over resources. Just as the kings of old increased their own power and influence by controlling the flow of resources to their subjects, today’s policymakers also know they can increase or preserve their power by being able to control who gets what, when, and how. Decentralization as a Means of Reducing Rent Seeking A second strategy for reducing the power of interest groups and corporate cronyism lies in decentralizing the power of regimes. As noted by Murray Rothbard in his history of economic thought, one of history’s most notable surges in rent-seeking behavior began with the rise of absolutism in Europe. As European regimes centralized political power, they also created a system of “state building, state privilege, and what might be called ‘state monopoly capitalism.’” This was also characterized by a system of “heavy royal expenditure, of high taxes, of … inflation and deficit finance.” In other words, it was an era in which the rapidly centralizing regimes seized unprecedented amounts of control over national economies and doled out privileges accordingly. Moreover, as suggested by Baysinger, Ekelund, and Tollison suggest in their essay “Mercantilism as a Rent-Seeking Society,” as regimes become more powerful, it makes more sense to devote more resources to rent-seeking. As regimes centralize, “the relative costs of negotiating favored treatment with a state in which authority [is] vested in a central figure” fall.1 If, on the other hand, regimes are decentralized, this raises the cost of rent seeking and make outcomes more difficult to predict. In other words, rent seeking declines when “the costs of negotiating and enforcing exclusive rights [are] relatively higher.”2 We can see how this has played out in the United States. Prior to the New Deal, most government spending in America was done at the local level. The federal regulatory state was weak. This meant that if one was seeking government favors, there was no easy single target from which immense rewards could be reaped. Large corporations and pressure groups could lobby for benefits state by state and city by city. But that’s expensive and time consuming. Certainly, many smaller organizations sought favors from state-level legislatures and bureaucrats. But the fractured political system limited the ease and extent to which single interest groups could obtain sizable government benefits. And decentralization certainly made it harder to gain national prominence and influence. That all changed with the New Deal and throughout the second half of the twentieth century as the federal government began to outspend the state governments and since immense new powers were now held by a well-funded and powerful federal government. It is no coincidence that nine of the twenty wealthiest counties in America are suburbs of Washington, DC. The symbiotic relationship between pressure groups and the regime is very rewarding. Today, the political system really is in many ways what H.L. Mencken suggested when he described elections as a sort of “advance auction of stolen goods.” The only answer lies in reducing the number of stolen goods available, or at least making it more costly to get them.",0,0
"Harris takes on graft in Guatemala and tells migrants ‘do not come’ U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said on Monday she had “robust” talks with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei on fighting corruption to deter immigration from Central America and bluntly warned migrants to not come to the United States.Since President Joe Biden took office in January, the number of migrants taken into custody per month at the U.S. Mexico border has risen to the highest levels in 20 years""Do not come. Do not come. The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our borders,"" Harris said at a news conference alongside Giammattei. ""If you come to our border, you will be turned back.""Harris also said a U.S. anti-corruption task force would work with local prosecutors to punish corrupt actors in the region.The Biden administration has identified corruption as an underlying cause of the poverty and violence driving record numbers of Central Americans to go to the United States.The corruption task force has been previously floated, but Harris gave more details, saying it will combine resources from the Justice, State and Treasury departments.In the build-up to Harris' visit to Guatemala, her first official overseas trip, differences of opinion emerged about the fight against graft, with corruption fighters feted by Washington being criticized by Giammattei.""We had a robust, candid and thorough conversation,"" Harris said at the news conference after a three-hour meeting with Giammattei, who said they had discussed U.S. concerns about developments in Guatemala.""The president and I discussed the importance of anti-corruption and the importance of an independent judiciary,"" Harris said. Washington has criticized the removal of a senior judge from Guatemala's top court, in what Giammattei has argued was a legitimate process.Giammattei defended his own record in fighting malfeasance, saying he had not been accused of wrongdoing and saying graft was not only a problem faced by politicians. The fight against drug trafficking needed to be an integral part of tackling corruption, he said.On the immigration front he announced a new processing center for migrants sent back from Mexico and the United States, which could increase capacity. He said the focus of the two countries should be on creating prosperity.1/5Guatemala's President Alejandro Giammattei and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris attend a bilateral meeting at the Palacio Nacional de la Cultura, during Harris' first international trip as Vice President to Guatemala and Mexico, in Guatemala City, Guatemala, June 7, 2021.

She said she was working on the ground in Guatemala.""I'm just focused on that kind of work as opposed to grand gestures,"" she said.But she also took flak from fellow Democrats like U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who said on Twitter she was disappointed by Harris's message to migrants.""Seeking asylum at any U.S. border is a 100% legal method of arrival,"" she tweeted. She said the United States has contributed to regime change and destabilization in Latin America for decades. ""We can't help set someone's house on fire and then blame them for fleeing.""The United States orchestrated a coup against democratically elected leftist government Jacobo Arbenz in 1954, ushering in decades of military governments and a civil war estimated to have killed more than 200,000 people by the time it ended in 1996.More recently, the U.S.-financed, U.N. Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala helped bring down democratically elected conservative President Otto Perez Molina, a former general, who resigned after massive protests triggered by an investigation into corruption in his government.The Biden administration on Monday also unveiled details of another task force of prosecutors to combat human smuggling in Central America and Mexico.U.S. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said the Joint Task Force Alpha would marshal Justice Department and Homeland Security resources against ""the most prolific and dangerous"" human smuggling and trafficking groups in the region, according to a statement. It said the group will complement efforts against corrupt actors.However, Washington's push to tackle ""root causes"" of migration in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras have been undermined by a backlash against anti-corruption bodies the United States considers independent but that local elites say are biased.Harris also met civil society leaders and entrepreneurs in Guatemala. The White House announced a $7.5 million commitment through USAID to support entrepreneurs in Guatemala, as well as millions more in investments in affordable housing, agri-businesses and loans to small businesses.Harris said she discussed sharing COVID-19 vaccines with Guatemala during Monday’s meeting.

"Sinovac CEO complained about anti-China comments in Brazil -sources The chief executive of Sinovac Biotech Ltd (SVA.O), the main supplier of COVID-19 vaccines to Brazil, complained last month to Brazilian diplomats in Beijing that anti-China comments in Brasilia were not helping with delayed shipments, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.Sinovac CEO Yin Weidong suggested an official retraction would make for a more ""fluid"" relationship between China and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, the sources said.Bolsonaro, who complained during his 2018 campaign about a string of Chinese acquisitions in Brazil, said in a speech on May 5 that the coronavirus pandemic could be ""chemical warfare"" waged by the fastest growing nation, without naming China.Two weeks later, at a meeting at Sinovac headquarters to discuss vaccine supplies, Weidong said a change of attitude in Brasilia would be ""convenient"" for a more ""fluid and positive"" relations with the Chinese government, according to a diplomatic cable sent to Brasilia and seen by newspaper O Globo.The two sources confirmed to Reuters the content of the  telegram reported by O Globo on Wednesday.The meeting came as supplies began dwindling of ingredients from China needed to fill and finish Sinovac's CoronaVac vaccine at Sao Paulo's Butantan Institute biomedical center.Sinovac has attributed delayed shipments to production bottlenecks and bureaucratic issues with export licenses.Brazil's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Bolsonaro's government has denied taking an antagonistic stance to China, which is Brazil's biggest trade partner.Yet a slowdown in vaccine ingredients from China has hampered Brazil's national immunization program, which was already well behind many countries, contributing to the world's deadliest outbreak outside the United States. Only 10% of Brazilians have been fully vaccinated.""They spoke about the importance of a good political relationship,"" one source said of Weidong's meeting with the diplomats.

"G7 Finance Ministers Reach ‘Historic Agreement’ on Biden’s Push for Global Minimum Corporate Tax of 15% Finance ministers from the Group of Seven nations have backed the Biden administration’s plans to set a global minimum tax of 15% on corporate earnings. Outside the G7, the plan has faced opposition from tax havens like Ireland. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met with her counterparts from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom in London on Saturday, where she made her administration’s case for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. The ministers agreed to back her proposal, with UK finance minister Rishi Sunak announcing the deal shortly after the meeting. “G7 finance ministers… after years of discussions, have reached a historic agreement to reform the global tax system to make it fit for the global digital age and, crucially, to make sure that it’s fair so that the right companies pay the right tax in the right places,” Sunak said in a video posted to Twitter. 🚨 At the @G7 in London today, my finance counterparts and I have come to a historic agreement on global tax reform requiring the largest multinational tech giants to pay their fair share of tax in the UK.👇The thread below explains exactly what this means. #G7UK pic.twitter.com/HdcK1HuM91— Rishi Sunak (@RishiSunak) June 5, 2021 Once implemented, the plan will make it more difficult for corporations to set up operations abroad, where tax rates are often dramatically lower. The US, for example, charges a flat corporate tax rate of 21%, which President Joe Biden has proposed – against Republican outcry – hiking to 28%. A US multinational seeking to avoid this rate can simply locate in a country like Ireland, where they pay only 12.5%, one of the lowest rates in Europe. All of the G7 nations already tax corporations at or above the proposed 15% rate, meaning smaller nations will be pressured to hike their rates if Biden’s plan is implemented. Ireland has already thrown cold water on the Biden administration’s plan. Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe told Sky News last month that his government has “significant reservations” about introducing a global minimum rate, claiming that such a move “means only certain countries, and certain size economies can benefit from that base.” Donohue, as current President of the Eurogroup, attended Saturday’s meeting, but the other ministers’ agreement doesn’t put Ireland’s low rate in jeopardy yet. The measures agreed on Saturday will need to find broader agreement at a meeting of the G20, set for next month in Venice, Italy. Though it has occasionally faced opposition at home, Ireland’s low rate has attracted foreign firms to the country since the early 1990s, with the influx of foreign investment one of the key drivers in the rapid economic growth that followed. However, proponents of a global minimum regime insist that hikes are needed to offset government spending, which ballooned across the developed world in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement last month, Yellen said that a “global race to the bottom” on corporate tax has undermined “the United States’ and other countries’ ability to raise the revenue needed to make critical investments” – such as the record-breaking federal budget proposed by Biden last week.

"AOC Rejects $100,000 Raised By Conservatives Trying To Help Out Her ‘Abuela’ Far-left Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) rejected a conservative fundraising effort to help her grandmother in fix up her home damaged by a hurricane. The episode began Wednesday when Ocasio-Cortez claimed on Twitter that she visited her sick grandmother in Puerto Rico, whose home had appeared to suffer some interior damage from Hurricane Maria in 2017. Just over a week ago, my abuela fell ill. I went to Puerto Rico to see her- my 1st time in a year+ bc of COVID.This is her home. Hurricane María relief hasn’t arrived.

AOC responded by accusing Walsh of perpetuating systemic racism in permitting Puerto Rico to remain a U.S. colony. You don’t even have a concept for the role that 1st-gen, first-born daughters play in their families.My abuela is okay.

From Walsh’s GoFundMe page: “On June 2nd, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez reported to Twitter that her dear abuela has fallen ill and continues to live in squalid conditions since her home was ravaged by Hurricane María. One cannot be certain of the cost to repair grandma’s house, but surely most of the work could be completed for the price of AOC’s shiny Tesla Model 3. As AOC pointed out to us, we “don’t even have a concept for the role that [incredibly successful children of two American citizens…] play in their families,” but clearly caring for their own grandparent isn’t part of it. Says the congresswoman, “…instead of only caring for [my own grandmother] & letting others suffer, I’m calling attention to the systemic injustices…” No, seriously. She really said that. Sadly, virtue-signaling isn’t going to fix abuela’s roof. So we are. Let’s all kick in to help save AOC’s abuela’s ancestral home. Any amount is appreciated, but the cost of a monthly lease payment on that Tesla is around $499…All proceeds will be donated to abuela, if she will accept them. Walsh reported on Saturday that “someone” in AOC’s family told GoFundMe that they won’t accept the money he raised. “UPDATE: ‘someone’ in AOC’s abuela’s family told GoFundMe that she won’t take the money, even though AOC previously claimed that her grandma was in dire straits (and it was Trump’s fault). @AOC still hasn’t acknowledged this effort or thanked us,” Walsh wrote.

"50-Year-Old Mother Charged With ‘Transphobic Hate Crime’ For Tweeting a Photo of a Suffragette Ribbon A 50-year-old mother in Scotland has been charged with a ‘transphobic hate crime’ and faces up to two years in prison after she retweeted an image of a suffragette ribbon. Yes, really. Unhinged transgender activists targeted Marion Millar after ludicrously claiming that the ribbon represented a noose. The Scottish feminist drew their ire after campaigning to protect biological women’s spaces and right to express themselves. “The messages investigated by officers are understood to include a retweeted photograph of a bow of ribbons in the green, white and purple colours of the Suffragettes, tied around a tree outside the Glasgow studio where a BBC soap opera is shot,” reports the Times. Millar was forced to attend a 2 hour police interview and was subsequently charged under the Malicious Communications Act. A woman faces two years in prison for tweets. One was a photo of a suffragette ribbon that was deemed threatening because it supposedly resembled a noose. So how do we go about repealing these laws that criminalise free expression?https://t.co/O0zc1ZH98d — Andrew Doyle (@andrewdoyle_com) June 4, 2021 After the interview, Millar quoted Satanic Verses author Salman Rushdie: “Nobody has the right to not be offended. That right doesn’t exist in any declaration I have ever read.” “Police and politicians seem to have lost sight of this,” she added. Millar opposes gender self-identification because she asserts that it makes it easier for male sex predators to hide their intentions. “Gender identity is a belief. Not a fact. Sex is a fact. Not a belief. The law has no business in transforming facts into beliefs and beliefs into facts,” stated a sign carried by one of Millar’s supporters. #WeAreAllMarionMillar Show of support for @millar_marion this morning! pic.twitter.com/3zUX36DBEp — forwomen.scot (@ForwomenScot) June 3, 2021 “Women won’t wheesht (shut up),” Calder said. “These charges are a fundamental attack on our human rights.

"World Economic Forum Pushes MIT Program that Automatically Detects “Disinformation Narratives” Online Misinformation and propaganda are as old and as present as human communication and societies organized into states. The curiously intense focus on these the last couple of years prompts many to believe such issues are now used as justification and smokescreen for suppressing legitimate but unwanted speech, and free expression-related civil rights. Depending on where you stand on that, you may be reassured or dismayed that the World Economic Forum (WEF) is one of the entities pushing hard the agenda of online misinformation presenting a huge danger today – and endorsing some “solutions.” One comes from MIT and its “Reconnaissance of Influence Operations (RIO)” – now there’s a name George Orwell would probably not kick out of his novels. Out the gate, RIO “establishes” that power of misinformation on social networks and elsewhere online is such as to sway elections, but also allow different points of view to be expressed, or as the program announcement put it, “sow discord.” Another dangerous point the MIT program aims to address is disinformation feeding “conspiracy theories” – but in light of the recent embarrassing U-turn on the “Wuhan lab leak” there’s no evidence of a firm and consensus-based definition of what a “conspiracy” even is. Rather, the category seems prone to political whim. But RIO looks to be designed to work under the false premise that these definitions are objective, and agreed on by all stakeholders. You’d think that as far as conspiracies go, the one about Russians electing a US president by exploiting social media is the most tired and by now well-debunked one. Nevertheless, that is one of the claims to fame made by those behind RIO and MIT Lincoln Laboratory’s Artificial Intelligence Software Architectures and Algorithms Group, whose goal is not only to “automatically” detect what they deem to be disinformation, but also what their machine learning algorithms are programed to identify as “disinformation narratives.” That means the tool would recognize the level of influence of accounts not only by their size in terms of followers, but also other elements as a measure of overall impact. Recognize for what reason? Highly likely to censor and remove. “The team envisions RIO being used by both government and industry as well as beyond social media and in the realm of traditional media such as newspapers and television,” the WEF said on its website.",0,1

"Northeast Power Prices Surge as Heat Wave Forces Millions to Crank Up Air-Conditioning With the latest heat wave subsiding in the northeastern U.S., after several days of dangerously high temperatures above 90 degrees, power prices skyrocketed as tens of millions turned down their thermostats.

Gary Cunningham, director of market research at Tradition Energy, said energy demands are way “above normal” for this time of year because of increasing air-conditioning use. New England’s grid operator could reach its summer peak in June instead of August, typically the hottest part of summer. Monday’s highs were 90-95 degrees in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area to New York City to Boston. Grid operator PJM Interconnection LLC, a regional transmission organization serving all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, issued a hot weather alert Monday. PJM requested owners of transmission lines and power plants to delay maintenance.

The chief medical adviser to the US president had briefed world leaders in 2020 on the possibility that the novel coronavirus leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China, said Gottlieb, when appearing on CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday. Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb says he was informed by a senior Trump administration official in spring that Dr. Fauci briefed world health leaders in Europe “that this could have been a potential lab leak…so those discussions were going on.” pic.twitter.com/2OlTg8bMof— Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) June 6, 2021 The ex-FDA chief, who served under then-President Donald Trump, had cited a former senior member of the Trump administration as testifying to Fauci’s statements at the time. Gottlieb, added that the same source had recently reconfirmed Fauci’s words dated to 2020. The former FDA commissioner’s book ‘Uncontrolled Spread: Why COVID-19 Crushed US and How We Can Defeat the Next Pandemic’ is set to come out in September. Last spring, when Dr. Fauci had attended a meeting of world health leaders in Europe around the World Health Assembly, he briefed them that the coronavirus outbreak could have been the result of a lab leak, and admitted that the strain looked unusual, Gottlieb revealed. Further on in the conversation on the CBS show, the former FDA chief underscored that when US scientists looked at the strain, they had suspicions. “And it takes time to do that analysis, and that dispelled some of those suspicions,” he added. Gottlieb believed that it was a mistake to look at the virus from only a scientific perspective, adding that it needed to be examined from a national security standpoint. A “scientific mindset looks at the virus and the virus’s behaviour and its sequence and draws a conclusion”, he said, emphasising that a national security assessment “looks at the behaviour of the Chinese government, looks at the behaviour of the lab, looks at other evidence around the lab, including the infections that we now know took place, and that changes the overall assessment”. According to Gottlieb, the “tools of national security weren’t deeply engaged at the outset.” “I think going forward now, looking at these kinds of risks, we need to judge them through the lens of a national security mindset,” he concluded. Former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, in a previous appearance on the same show, slammed China, which he said, was able to provide “exculpatory” evidence proving that COVID did not leak from a lab, but has so far refused to do so. He also cited evidence supposedly in favour of the theory after reports claimed three scientists who worked at the The Wuhan Institute of Virology were hospitalised in November 2019. US media reports suggesting that the employees of the Wuhan Institute fell gravely ill right ahead of the outbreak of COVID-19 have been dismissed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry as “smear campaigns and blame shifting”. Fauci Under Fire Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), is currently under fire over accusations that he was not forthcoming about the idea that COVID-19 might have originated from a lab leak in his discussions within the administration and in the other work he was carrying out. Republican lawmakers have been demanding that Fauci be fired. On Saturday, Republican House Representative Matt Gaetz claimed in an interview that Dr Fauci “has blood on his hands”.Earlier, two top House Republicans said it was “imperative” for Fauci to testify before congressional committees and provide information related to the origins of COVID-19. The barrage of criticism aimed at Fauci has also been fuelled by the recent release by BuzzFeed of 3,200 pages of the chief medical adviser’s emails dating back to the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. In one of the alleged emails, Peter Daszak, head of the EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit organisation with ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, reportedly thanked Fauci for “downplaying the possibility” that COVID-19 had escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Fauci, however, dismissed the recent allegations targeting him and his National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “Are you really saying that we are implicated because we gave a multi-billion dollar institution $120,000 a year for bat surveillance?” he said, according to the Financial Times, in a reference to the grant that, via EcoHealth Alliance, ended up at the lab in China which has been conducting tests on bat coronaviruses for decades. Many who support the “lab leak” theory have been insisting that the mere fact the city that houses the lab became ground zero for the outbreak is too great a coincidence. The idea the COVID-19 virus escaped from a Wuhan lab in China – something that was regarded as somewhat of a “fringe theory” until recently, is now the subject of an official review, after US President Joe Biden ordered the intelligence community to redouble efforts to investigate the origins of the coronavirus and to report their findings to him within 90 days, “including on whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident”. The US President acknowledged that a majority of the intelligence community had “coalesced” around two scenarios, but “do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other”. In March, the World Health Organisation released the full version of its report on the origins of the coronavirus, in which the WHO called a leak of COVID-19 from a laboratory very unlikely, suggesting that the virus was most likely transmitted to humans from bats via another animal.",0,0
"America First Conservatives Bash Daily Wire’s ‘Pathetic’ Fundraiser For AOC’s Abuela Neoconservative media organization The Daily Wire is receiving heavy criticism from conservatives on social media for orchestrating a GoFundMe publicity stunt that aims to raise tens of thousands of dollars for socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s grandmother. While AOC has drawn heavy criticism for complaining about her grandmother’s living conditions while enjoying a luxurious lifestyle in D.C., the Daily Wire’s fundraiser has been castigated for extreme tone-deafness at a time when conservatives are enduring record levels of financial persecution. “Just over a week ago, my abuela fell ill,” Ocasio-Cortez originally wrote on Twitter. “I went to Puerto Rico to see her- my 1st time in a year+ bc of COVID. This is her home. Hurricane María relief hasn’t arrived. Trump blocked relief $ for PR. People are being forced to flee ancestral homes, & developers are taking them.” Although Cortez admitted later on in the thread that “for the record – my abuela is doing okay,” and “She had a place to go to and be cared for,” the Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh quickly organized a page for AOC’s “abuela” on GoFundMe that was heavily promoted by other Daily Wire personnel.

"Ted Cruz: Fauci Emails Show Facebook Operating as Extension of Government — Now Exposed To Legal Liability Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said that Dr. Anthony Fauci’s emails show Facebook played a major role in suppressing critical COVID-19 information on behalf of the federal government. During an interview on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures”, Cruz explained that, according to Fauci’s emails, Facebook acted as an agent of the government and so is now open to legal liability. “In the email dump that came out, it makes clear that this is not just being sloppy. It is systematic and it is systematically an effort to mislead the American people,” Cruz told host Maria Bartiromo. “And as you noted he wasn’t doing it alone but was doing it with much of the US government behind him and with Facebook and Big Tech operating as an extension of the US government in order to silence any views that disagreed, not with the science, because he wasn’t looking for the science. He was suppressing the science,” he continued. “…If you went out and posted the facts that led, a year ago, to the very strong likelihood that the coronavirus escaped from a Chinese government lab in Wuhan, China. If you posted that a year ago and they took it down, I think there is a very good argument you have a cause of action against Facebook.” Cruz explained how the emails reveal that Facebook acted as an agent for the government as the coronavirus pandemic unfolded, peaked, and then receded. “And Facebook would ordinarily say, ‘We’re a private company. We’re not liable.'” Cruz said. “Well, you know, when they act at the behest of the government, when they contact Fauci, when they say, ‘Should we censor this?’ and Fauci says, ‘Yes’, and they censor it for the federal government, and then magically when the government changes its mind and says, ‘Oh, all those facts that were there a year ago, now you’re allowed to talk about it’ — they stop censoring it with the flip of a switch.” “That lays a very strong argument that Facebook is operating as a state agency and that opens very serious legal liability,” Cruz added. The doctor who thanked Dr. Fauci for dismissing the Wuhan lab leak theory is the same guy who gave $600k to the lab, “investigated” it for the WHO and then acted as a Facebook fact-checker censoring info on the Wuhan lab leak theory.",0,0

"Yet Another Scientific Study Concludes COVID Is Likely Lab Engineered Another new scientific study has concluded that it is more likely than not that the COVID pandemic originated with a virus engineered inside a lab. Dr. Stephen Quay and Berkeley physics professor Richard Muller revealed the findings in The Wall Street Journal Sunday, noting that “The most compelling reason to favor the lab leak hypothesis is firmly based in science.” The scientists added that “COVID-19 has a genetic footprint that has never been observed in a natural coronavirus.” The research points to the genome sequencing of the virus ‘CGG-CGG’, which is one of 36 sequencing patterns observed, but does not occur in nature. “The CGG-CGG combination has never been found naturally. That means the common method of viruses picking up new skills, called recombination, cannot operate here,” the scientists assert. “A virus simply cannot pick up a sequence from another virus if that sequence isn’t present in any other virus,” they add, while also noting that the CGG-CGG combination IS commonly used in ‘gain of function’ research, which is known to have been used with coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The scientists urge that those who believe COVID-19 jumped from animals to humans “must explain why it happened to pick its least favorite combination: CGG-CGG.” They further ask for an explanation as to “Why did it replicate the choice the lab’s gain-of-function researchers would have made?” “Yes, it could have happened randomly, through mutations. But do you believe that?” the authors of the study ask, adding “At the minimum, this fact—that the coronavirus, with all its random possibilities, took the rare and unnatural combination used by human researchers—implies that the leading theory for the origin of the coronavirus must be laboratory escape.” This latest study comes on the heels of a revitalised focus on scientific research by Professor Angus Dalgleish of St George’s Hospital, University of London and Norwegian virologist Birger Sorensen which presents compelling evidence suggesting the virus was manufactured in a laboratory. As the scientists noted, they were ostracised and ignored until recently when intelligence findings revealed that workers at the Wuhan lab fell sick with COVID-19 symptoms in November 2019. As the global pandemic unfolded, scores of scientists came forward suggesting the genome sequencing of the virus was unnatural, and should be further investigated. The lab leak theory was effectively shut down, however, when scientists led by Dr Peter Daszak “orchestrated a ‘bullying’ campaign and coerced top scientists into signing off on a letter to The Lancet journal aimed at removing blame for Covid-19 from the Wuhan lab he was funding with US money.” Daszak, who keeps appearing as the lead figure in investigations of the research he funded with US grant money via his own organisation, reportedly used his influence to get The Lancet to publish the letter, which stated that to even suggest the lab leak theory had any credibility was equal to spreading “fear, rumours, and prejudice.” The release of Dr Fauci’s emails has also reconfirmed that Fauci was discussing the lab leak scenario with other scientists, and knew full well that it was a distinct possibility, despite making statements to the contrary in public, before any robust scientific research into the matter had been carried out. Ty & Charlene Bollinger break down the latest in the leaked Fauci e-mails that expose his many lies to the American public. Now former head of the Food and Drug Administration, Scott Gottlieb, has revealed that Fauci briefed world health leaders in the spring of 2020 that the lab leak was a possibility. Appearing on CBS News this past weekend, Gottlieb admitted that Fauci told government health advisors that the virus “looked unusual,” and that scientists he was working with “had suspicions” that it was manipulated. Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb says he was informed by a senior Trump administration official in spring that Dr. Fauci briefed world health leaders in Europe “that this could have been a potential lab leak…so those discussions were going on.” pic.twitter.com/2OlTg8bMof— Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) June 6, 2021 ——————————————————————————————————————— ALERT!

"Fauci’s NIH Funded Wuhan Military Scientist Who Died Mysteriously After Filing COVID Vaccine Patent As we move further down the rabbit hole of exactly what in the devil has been going on in China’s ‘bat labs,’ we now turn our attention to one Zhou Yusen – a Chinese military scientist specializing in coronaviruseswho collaborated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s “Bat Woman,” Zhengli Shi – with at least one project to geneticially manipulate coronaviruses having been funded by three grants from the National Institutes of Heath (NIH) – home to Dr. Anthony Fauci – via US universities, according to documents obtained by The Weekend Australian (ostensibly leaked by Aussie intelligence). The previously undisclosed NIH funding of a PLA military scientist is separate from millions in grants awarded EcoHealth alliance, which also collaborated with the WIV. The revelation shows American money was funding risky ­research on coronaviruses with People’s Liberation Army scientists – including decorated military scientist Zhou Yusen and the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s “Bat Woman”, Shi Zhengli. Now we learn that Zhou, 54, is dead – three months after filing a patent for a COVID-19 vaccine in Feb. 2020. According to the report, Zhou’s May 2020 death went largely under the radar, despite the fact that he was an award-winning scientist at the PLA’s Laboratory of Infection and Immunity at the Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology. “There were no reports paying tribute to his life. His death was only mentioned in passing in a Chinese-media report in July and at the end of a December scientific paper. Both had the word ­“deceased” in brackets after his name.” And while Zhou’s death may have been suspicious (or he may have simply died of COVID), the revelation that the US government was funding his research with the WIV may provide a clue as to why US officials – Dr. Fauci (backed by the ‘scientific community’ after his lapdog, EcoHelath Alliance’s Peter Daszak, penned a ‘natural origin or you’re a lunatic‘ letter in the Lancet) – peddled the CCP’s ‘natural origin’ theory, while any suggestion that it could have been created in and/or leaked from the very lab which received NIH dollars was strictly verboten. Emails released under a Freedom of Information request from Buzzfeed this week showed that, in the early days of the pandemic, Dr Fauci was concerned that US funding had gone towards gain-of-function research in China.In other emails, scientists wrote to Dr Fauci expressing the preliminary view that the SARS-CoV-2 genome appeared “inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory” and that it had some features that “potentially look engineered”. -The Weekend Australian In short, ‘conflict of interest’ doesn’t even begin to explain what Fauci is now going to have to explain the next time Rand Paul has him in the hot seat. The revelation shows American money was funding risky ­research on coronaviruses with People’s Liberation Army scientists – including decorated military scientist Zhou Yusen and the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s “Bat Woman”, Shi Zhengli.…National security sources said the ties between Zhou and Dr Shi ­supported claims by US intelligence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was engaged in “secret military activity.” -The Australian How long was China sitting on the genetic sequence for SARS-CoV-2? If we’re considering the timeline and its implications, Zhou died three months after filing a Feb. 24, 2020 patent application for a COVID-19 vaccine. While this could mean that he was working on a COVID-19 vaccine before the virus became public knowledge in December 2019, keep in mind that Moderna was able to design the sequence for their COVID-19 vaccine just two days after Chinese officials released its genetic sequence on Jan. 11, 2020 – filing for their first related patent in March, two months later. Also note that Zhou had been working on coronavirus vaccines since at least 2006 in response the original SARS-CoV outbreak – authoring a study which found that “the vaccines containing the (receptor-binding domain) of SARS-CoV S protein may induce sufficient neutralising antibodies and long-term ­protective immunity against SARS-CoV challenge in the ­established mouse model.” So, assuming an expert would need approximately two months to go from genomic sequence to patent application, it implies that China withheld the genetic sequence for a month before its Jan. 11 public release. Or, Zhou may have had more of a ‘head start’ than that. “This is something we have never seen achieved before, raising the question of whether this work may have started much ­earlier,” said Nikolai Petrovsky from Flinders University. (And if one wants to explore the implications assuming SARS-CoV-2 was genetically engineered, Karl Denninger has some thoughts below) And while we may never know the full extent of Zhou’s role in all of this, he and ‘bat woman’ Zhengli were working on a COVID vaccine right before the pandemic. Per the Weekend Australian: Right before the pandemic, Zhou and three other scientists from the PLA-run Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology – Yuehong Chen, Lei He and Shishui Sun – partnered with two Wuhan Institute of Virology scientists – Dr Shi and Jing Chen – and eight Chinese scientists now based in the US at the University of Minnesota and the Lindsley Kimball Research Institute, New York Blood Centre. Their paper, titled Molecular Mechanism for Antibody-­Dependent Enhancement of Coronavirus Entry, was submitted to the Journal of Virology on November 27, 2019, and was published on February 14, 2020. The research examined MERS and SARS coronaviruses as avenues for antibody-based ­antiviral drug therapy to treat coronaviruses.Their paper had some positive results: “Taken together, our ­results show that RBD-specific neutralising MAbs bind to the same region on coronavirus spikes as viral receptors do, trigger conformational changes of the spikes as viral receptors do, and mediate ADE through the same pathways as viral-receptor-dependent viral entry.”They found this “novel molecular mechanism for antibody-enhanced viral entry” could “guide future vaccination and ­antiviral strategies”.This study was conducted “in vitro”, meaning in a petri dish or test tube, using humanised kidney and lung cells. Their last paragraph indicated the next step in a future paper would be to conduct “in vivo” experiments with ­humanised mice or primates. A paper published in Nature ­Reviews Immunology 18 months later, in April this year, would find that “neutralising monoclonal antibodies” could help the treatment of Covid-19. Meanwhile, Zhou’s patent application states: “The invention ­relates to the field of biomedicine, and relates to a Covid-19 ­vaccine, preparation methods and applications. The fusion ­protein provided by the invention can be used to develop the Covid-19 protein vaccine and a drug for preventing or treating the Covid-19.” Yusen Zhou (周育森) (‡) 1.

The NIH-PLA Network：left to right = infiltration pathway pic.twitter.com/M5E14ylSM9— 德意志之鹰 (@dezying) June 4, 2021 What does this all mean now? Karl Denninger has a few thoughts via market-ticker.org, and is notably very suspicious of the patent timing (edited for brevity): So what do we now know? China’s militarywas in fact involved at the Wuhan lab. It was not just a civilian operation. This, by the way, has been repeatedly denied over the last year and change.The lab’s scientists knew not only the sequencing of the virus but in addition had a patentable way to create an alleged vaccine before the pandemic was public. It takes time to draft patents and figure them out. Quite a lot of time, in fact — not a couple weeks or months. It takes time to prove up patent material, including in the case of a vaccine. To patent something you must be able to demonstrate it; you cannot patent ideas, only embodiments of ideas. In that case you would have to prove immunogenicity which isn’t instantaneous; it takes weeks or even months to get through original science on this with animals and then humans, which means the date of knowledge was not February 24th it was months or even further before that.That means they were working on this even before that time because to work on a vaccine you have to know you must or would want to work on it in the first place. This in turn means they knew damn well there was a virulent virus in the wild prior to that date, or they released it or intended to release it into the wild on purpose. Nobody comes up with a vaccine for a virus you intend to and have confined entirely within a laboratory in animal or cell culture testing; that’s worthless. Without an isolate to create a vaccine for and a virus outside of a lab environment where vaccination becomes a “thing” that might be required and thus have value why would you do the work to create one? What’s the timeline on all this? Many, many months or even a couple of years. That means either the virus was “out” for many months to a couple of years before February of 2020 (not a month or two) or the Chinese intended to release it in the fall of 2019. In either case the evidence is now overwhelming that this was not a virus that “magically appeared” one fine day in late December having come naturally from bats and perhaps pangolins. That is not just improbable anymore — it is now, on the manifest weight of the evidence, impossible. … Next up is exactly what sort of vaccine patent we’re talking about here? Specifically how is it that the “stiffened” areas in the viral vector and mRNA shots we’re using in the US came to be known and proved up? How did Moderna and Pfizer know they needed to do that? That sort of study takes months if not years too, not days or weeks, to both come up with it and then prove it actually works as expected. Remember that Covid-19 has a rather-unique site on the spike called the “furin-cleavage” area which it uses to “fold” and get into the cell; the S1 unit attaches, the cleavage area “folds” and then the second part penetrates the cell wall like a spear. SARS and MERS both lack this structure so there was no “prior art” to use and in the first couple of months the characterizing of all of this was pretty darn new. Yet the “official story” is that these folks had a proposed candidate configuration, including the replacement of encodings to “stiffen” that area within days of the publication of the viral RNA sequence for Covid-19. Is the completed work in that area what the Chinese “gave” us complete with that part of the work already done? That would explain how it happened that quickly, wouldn’t it? I’d sure like to understand how someone — anyone — does that sort of work complete with the lab verification in cell cultures and animals, reachig those conclusions in days. What are the connections there? I’d like a full explanation of that please. * * * As would we.

""We have saved three more people; they are injured,"" he added.An injured passenger, who had been travelling on the train that derailed, recounted how one calamity led to another.""We felt as if we had been thrown away,"" the man, who had a bandaged head, told a television reporter from hospital, speaking of the initial derailing of his train.""The second train then hit our train that caused more damage,"" he said.The Pakistan Railways spokesman said several carriages of the first train fell across the adjacent track after the derailment in the Ghotki district.1/5Paramilitary soldiers and rescue workers gather at the site following a collision between two trains in Ghotki, Pakistan June 7, 2021.

"Cricketing Authorities Considering Exposing Another Player For Tweets He Posted When He Was 15 Following the international suspension of cricketer Ollie Robinson for tweets he posted when he was 18, the ECB is now considering whether to expose the identity of another player for posting “offensive” tweets when he was 15. Yes, really. As we previously highlighted, Robinson was “made an example of” by cricketing authorities after his teenage tweets, which largely consisted of a few “racist” words and some lads’ banter, were uncovered by offense archeologists. Now another cricketer could be about to face cancellation “Wisden.com chose to obscure the identity of the player, who was 15 at the of the tweet, but did include details of the post, including ‘your going out with a asian’ and three hashtags: ‘Asianthroughandthrough’, ‘hweolloo’ and ‘c****y’,” reports the Daily Mail. Wow. Big deal. According to the Mail, the ECB is “considering” whether to publicly name the individual, opening him up to be targeted by witch hunt mobs and forced into a groveling apology, which as it proved for Robinson, will achieve absolutely nothing. So according to the left, “cancel culture doesn’t exist,” and yet another sports star may be about to say goodbye to his whole career for tweets he posted when he was literally a child. Completely absurd. ——————————————————————————————————————— ALERT! In the age of mass Silicon Valley censorship It is crucial that we stay in touch. I need you to sign up for my free newsletter here.

"Trump: ‘China Must Pay’ Reparations For Unleashing Coronavirus Pandemic President Donald Trump issued a strong message against China during his speech in North Carolina on Saturday, stating the country is directly responsible for the COVID pandemic. “We should all declare with one unified voice that China must pay. They must pay,” Trump said to the cheering crowd of Republicans. Trump called for China to pay the world $10 trillion to compensate for the economic devastation and wipe out any debts other countries may owe. “All nations should work together to present China a bill for a minimum of $10 trillion to compensate for the damage,” Trump said. “As a first step, all countries should collectively cancel any debt they owe to China as a down payment on reparations.” “The nations of the world should no longer owe money to China,” he added. Trump also called for a “firm 100 percent tariff on all goods made in China”, but added that Joe Biden would never allow that to happen to his benefactor. “I don’t think they want to keep Biden happy. I don’t think they care too much about Biden, to be honest,” he said. The former president also took a victory lap for correctly claiming that COVID-19 originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. “The media, the Democrats, and the so-called experts are now finally admitting what I first said 13 months ago: The evidence demonstrates that the virus originated in a Chinese government lab,” Trump said. Trump had first called for China to pay up $10 trillion to American and the world in a statement last week, for the “death and destruction they have caused.” President Trump takes a moment to deliver a powerful message of hope for America.",0,0

"The Origins of Keynesian Economics: How Did It Get So Popular? The British Austrian economist W.H. Hutt was a great critic of Keynes’s economic theories. However, his speculations on why the New Economics revolution happened are even more fascinating. Hutt shows it to be a fundamentally dishonest undertaking. Keynes held a long-standing belief in inflation and public spending. His General Theory was the culmination of his search for an intellectual foundation on which to support his belief. Yet it was an unstable foundation. Had he stated his thesis in clear terms, it would have been seen as noncontroversial in some parts and in the rest untrue. The staggering complexity, deliberate obscurantism and “dialectical tricks” of The General Theory were part of a necessary stratagem of disguise.1 At the time of publication of Keynes’s General Theory, the economy of the United Kingdom was in deep stagnation. Britain had been suffering from chronic levels of mass unemployment. Hutt diagnosed the situation as a pricing problem. Many wages were fixed above market-clearing levels. This came about because a deliberate monetary deflation had been instituted to compensate for the wartime inflation. This was done in order to maintain gold convertibility of the British pound at the prewar gold backing. However, some segments of the labor market had fixed wages at higher nominal levels which perhaps were above market clearance before and were surely much more so after the rollback. Wage rigidity was primarily the doing of labor unions through strike threats and organized coercion. Generous welfare incentive payments, which encouraged the idle to remain unemployed, were a contributing factor. Depressed conditions made labor less valuable to business firms. Unemployed workers could have worked at some wage. A fair-value offer would be lower in bad times than in good times, but productive labor always has some value to the employer. Yet the price rigidities and disincentives made idleness (perhaps supplemented by off-the-books side hustles) more attractive than regular employment. Reading between the lines, contemporary British economists were aware that there was no fundamental reason that a free market in labor could not put people back to work. Prices above market clearance result in a surplus. Profit motivation by business firms, and competition in labor markets among workers would push wages down until the labor surplus was no more. Markets can and will clear—at higher quantities and lower prices. Understanding this point did not require an entirely new theory of economics. British economists were also aware that the main barriers to wages that would clear labor markets were political. The unions were a formidable foe. Hutt described “the belief of some economists that any policy which aims at the removal of man-made barriers … to the pricing of outputs at market-clearing levels, is politically impossible.”2 F.A. Hayek on the same issue wrote that Keynes assumed that “a direct lowering of money wages could be brought about only by a struggle so painful and prolonged that it could not be contemplated.” The cure for the British disease was, then, a political one. Had economists and politicians attempted to marshal public opinion in favor of full-on confrontation against the institutional barriers preventing the price system from working, then the economy could have recovered. The inflexible wages preventing the full participation of labor in productive activity would have flexed. Hutt hoped for the emergence of “a really great statesman, with wise and courageous advisers” who would tell the public the truth: that stagnation was caused by the monopolistic behavior of labor unions; that unemployment benefits discouraged production; and that market pricing—even if some prices were lower—would bring better days ahead for all.3 If influencers had told the hard truth, then public opinion might have responded. Yet it was not so. Those in position to speak out were unwilling to do so, for fear of losing votes and ending careers. And due to a British common law tradition of respect for labor unions, such criticism would not have gone down well. The loss of dole would be equally unwelcome. The cancel culture of the day had its way. Hutt laid the blame equally on the economics profession for knowing—but not telling—the truth.4 Hutt gives the example of Pigou, whose published work demonstrated that he understood the issue. However, “he still conspicuously refrained from recommending the only remaining non-inflationary solution, that of pricing labour’s inputs lower so that they would be within reach of final consumers’ pockets.”5 Political and economic elites began to look for an easier way out. Having ruled out the truth, “they groped for other diagnoses.”6 The problem was how to avoid the pain of confronting the real issue. The solution was inflation. In proper doses, and if precisely targeted, it was thought, inflation could break the logjam. If consumer goods prices rose against rigid nominal wages, real wages would fall until they reached labor’s marginal product. Businesses could then hire. And labor could hold its head high, and proudly pretend that it had not taken a pay cut. All gain, no pain. Thus began a subtle shift in elite opinion, which had up to that time considered inflation a shameful thing. While openly advocating monetary debasement was not (quite) yet respectable in British policy circles, “the notion that ‘cheap money’ could bring prosperity and mitigate unemployment without serious contra-effects was growing in industrial and business circles in both continents,” wrote Hutt.7 The notion began to catch on that, if aggregate purchasing power was deficient because aggregate supply was deficient (owing to input prices and output prices having been forced—by trade union or other monopolistic pressures—above full employment levels) this deficiency might be remedied in some manner by the stimulation of aggregate demand.8 The obstacle to this path was Say’s law. This is the name we now give to a truth articulated by Ricardo, Mill, and Say during the general glut debate. This was an eighteenth-century controversy between Malthus and the three classical economists on the proposition that depressions were caused by an oversupply of goods in general. Looked at differently this could be described as a deficiency of demand in general. Ricardo, Mill, and Say observed that the supply of one good constitutes a demand for some other good, supplied by another producer. If every demand constitutes a supply and vice versa, then demand in general and supply in general are identical. They are only different aspects of the same phenomenon. While there can be a glut of a particular good, demand in general can never be excess or deficient relative to supply. Say’s law and price flexibility formed Hutt’s two-pronged critique of the policy of inflation. Hutt argued that demand in Britain was indeed deficient, but only because supply was deficient. And supply was deficient, because the services of some workers’ labor were not priced for market clearance. Those workers were idle, because employers were not willing or able to raise their bids. Hutt writes that Keynesianism before Keynes (stimulation of demand through inflation) was “widespread” in Britain and the US. Keynes was known to have drawn inspiration from the monetary cranks—a term applied to a collection of historical thinkers who have advanced schemes for printing the way to prosperity.9 Hayek’s article on Foster and Catchings deals with an American version of Keynes’s paradox of thrift ten years before. Hutt (citing Keynes’s biographer, Roy Harrod) states that Keynes had spent at least a dozen years prior to the publication of his General Theory fixated on his lifetime goal. He badly wanted to be the advocate of inflation and public spending. He intuitively felt that this was what the country needed. Finding defensible economic reasoning was another thing. A century of sound economic theory stood in his way. And there was that pesky Say’s law. Inflation was still disreputable, even “suicidal.”10 He could not see a clear path forward. Keynes spent the 1920s and ’30s “searching for arguments to support a conviction.”11 Hutt explains, His “hunch” throughout was that control of expenditure through monetary and fiscal policy could solve the problems of maladjustment expressed in unemployment. And he seems originally to have believed that this could be done without the disastrous sociological consequences of [inflation]. His intellectual speculations consisted, I think, of a groping around—with great ingenuity—for ways of thinking which appeared to support his “hunch,” selecting and eagerly clutching those which appeared to do so, and inhibiting those which did not. The process was unconscious.12 Because the conclusion was fixed, only the means of reaching it needed to change: Supremely confident, conscious of his reputation and rhetorical skill, he appears to have been self-critical only when his previous speculations had tended to lead him away from instead of toward conclusions to which he was intuitively attached. When he discarded concepts and apparatus which he had earlier introduced, it was because he had found more convincing ways, although sometimes quite different and inconsistent ways, of stating a case which, in its essence, he had not modified…. while his convictions about policy seem indeed to have been unshakable, he constantly changed the arguments, assumptions, terminology, and formulas which could be used to justify those convictions. In other words, his fundamental ideas were subject to change only in respect of the particular concepts, formulas, or jargon in which he dressed them.13 Proving that markets don’t clear without violating the laws of economics was roughly as difficult as proving 1+1 =3. This task required an extraordinary degree of rhetoric to paper over the flagrant violations of logic. An initial attempt in 1930, Keynes’s A Treatise on Money, failed when Hayek tore it to shreds in a devastating review.14 The goal remained, but a different route was needed. Where he had failed once, Keynes succeeded with The General Theory. Perhaps the most obscurantist work in the history of economic thought, the book was lipstick on the inflationary pig. Through a rehabilitation of the discarded monetary cranks, a fallacious attempt to refute Say’s law, a policy of spending and inflation, was derived. It was necessary to dress up the conclusion in a model of staggering complexity so as to have plausible deniability that it was, in reality, so simple a thing. Even Keynes supporters acknowledge that the book is poorly written and impenetrable. The impenetrable nature of the writing was a feature, not a bug. Hutt explained, “an inspired insight enabled the Keynesians to perceive that, if inflation were called by another name, ‘the maintenance of effective demand’ for instance, [it could] become respectable and even respected”15 Hutt’s commentary continues: But Keynes, perceiving that it would be politically suicidal to mention the unmentionable, saw a way out through the most successful conjuring trick in history which, deceiving an audience that wished to be deceived, led to its being hailed as a great discovery, as revolutionary and important as Einstein’s theory of relativity. I am not accusing Keynes of intellectual dishonesty. He deceived himself with his “conjuring trick.”16 The success of The General Theory came, in Hutt’s view, from three factors. First, it gave academic legitimacy to inflationism, which governments wanted to do anyway. They had only been prevented because it was widely considered to be an unsound policy. Second, it provided an escape hatch from what Hutt described as “the ‘political impossibility’ of persuading any government to protect or facilitate [market pricing of labor].17 The third and final component was as a theoretical bridge to the policies that Keynes had always wanted. Hutt explained Keynes’s joy over the success of The General Theory this way: “That Keynes was exhilarated is understandable. He had found arguments to support policies which he knew were bound to be extraordinarily popular and influential” and “[t]he thesis that underconsumption is the origin of recession is, of course, tailor-made for political acceptability. It meant an enormous advantage for the popularity of ‘the new economics’ against the old.”18 Hayek famously decided not to write a critique of The General Theory. Had he done so, would the revolution have been stopped? Many since have said so, but perhaps not. In his magisterial The Keynesian Episode: A Reassessment, Hutt says that the success was largely a factor of Keynes’s personality, charisma, and immense influence within the academy and in the political sphere. So great was his reach that his opposition could be fatal to a career in public life. It was almost as if Keynes had something akin to Jedi mind tricks. Hutt was befuddled that eminent economists—men who had demonstrated a sound grasp of the discipline—would inexplicably become brain dead in Keynes’s presence. He could win any argument in person, but when forced to defend his points in writing—giving opponents time to penetrate what Murray N. Rothbard called “a vast network of fallacy”—not so much.19 Hutt documents a “retreat” by Keynes, and by his followers after he left the scene. The major original thesis of the work, unemployment equilibrium, was quickly seen to be a fallacy. From there the major propositions of his work fell one by one, either to friendly fire as his followers tactically retreated, or through hostile attack. Yet The General Theory created an enduring structure that remains in place with no foundations. Hutt, in 1974, wrote: Paradoxically [these economists] still seem to leave the impression that, after all, Say’s law does not work—at least not in the manner in which the old general equilibrium analysis suggested that it did; and they suggest that in some way the world must feel grateful to Keynes, not so much for his contributions to economic method as for the beneficial policy consequences of his General Theory up to some unspecified turning-point some years ago.20 Like a tailored suit, the revolution was custom fit to the policy of inflation and debt. It succeeded due to its failures. On reading the book, Hutt though it would “have a quite unparalleled influence by reason of what [he] judged to be its demerits as a contribution to thought.”21 He described the revolution as “a maze [that] gradually led the majority of economists … [in] which many are still lost.”22 Keynes developed the theory to support his lifelong goal, only to see politicians and central bankers use his revolution to support their goals. The financial media and Fed economists seek to promote consumption, Congress is addicted to “stimulus,” and Fed economists believe that by printing money they are supporting production. Hutt’s speculations go a long way toward answering the question of how we got here.

"Head of Austrian state holdings group, stung by texts with Kurz, quits The head of Austrian state holdings group OBAG, Thomas Schmid, stepped down on Tuesday as prosecutors investigate whether Chancellor Sebastian Kurz perjured himself in saying he was not involved in appointing Schmid and OBAG's supervisory board.Text message exchanges between Kurz and Schmid, a civil servant loyal to Kurz's conservative party, were part of a parliamentary commission's investigation into possible corruption revealed in the so-called Ibiza sting video that brought down Kurz's coalition with the far right in 2019.  read more In the texts, widely reported in Austrian media, Kurz tells Schmid before his appointment that he will get ""everything you want"" and Schmid expresses his thanks and ""love"" to Kurz. At best, the exchanges are embarrassing; at worst, they could help lead to a criminal conviction for Kurz that would threaten his job.  read more Kurz denies any wrongdoing and says he expects to be charged but not convicted.""After intensive consultations within the supervisory board, the supervisory board has together with Mr Schmid come to the conclusion that the immediate termination of Mr Thomas Schmid's role represents a necessary step for OBAG,"" Austrian Holding AG (OBAG) said in a statement.OBAG had said in April that Schmid would not stay on beyond the expiry of his term in March 2022.The company manages assets including a 51% stake in utility Verbund (VERB.VI), 31.5% of oil company OMV (OMVV.VI) and 52.9% of Austrian Post (POST.VI).OBAG Director Christine Catasta, who oversees investment management, is taking over temporarily as chief executive.Opposition parties seized on the resignation to attack Kurz, whom they accuse of running a system of nepotistic appointments.""The Kurz system is buckling further,"" Joerg Leichtfried of the Social Democrats said in a statement, adding that Schmid's departure was long overdue but why it happened now was unclear.""The responsibility for this culture of arrogance and overestimating oneself lies with Chancellor Kurz, who hoisted Schmid into the job,"" he added.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,0
"Analysis: India’s vaccine inequity worsens as countryside languishes Urban Indians are getting COVID-19 shots much faster than the hundreds of millions of people living in the countryside, government data shows, reflecting rising inequity in the nation’s immunisation drive.In 114 of India's least developed districts - collectively home to about 176 million people - authorities have administered just 23 million doses in total.That's the same number of doses as have been administered across nine major cities -- New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Thane and Nagpur -- which combined have half the population of the least developed districts.The disparity was even stronger last month, after the government allowed private sales of vaccines for adults aged under 45 years, an offer which favoured residents of cities with larger private hospital networks. For the first four weeks of May, those nine cities gave 16% more doses than the combined rural districts, data from the government’s Co-WIN vaccination portal shows.""My friends from the city were vaccinated at private hospitals,"" said Atul Pawar, a 38-year-old farmer from Satara, a rural western district of Maharashtra, India's wealthiest state. ""I am ready to pay, but doses are not available and district borders are sealed because of the lockdown.""The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said in a statement on Saturday that reports of vaccine inequity in India were ""inaccurate and speculative in nature"".""Liberalised pricing and accelerated national COVID-19 vaccination strategy ensures vaccine equity,"" it said, adding that smaller cities were also getting doses like the big ones.The ministry said it had asked states with fewer private hospitals to review the status of their vaccination campaigns and encourage some government-empanelled hospitals to strike deals with vaccine companies if need be.India has administered more than 222 million doses since starting its campaign in mid-January - only China and the United States have administered more - but it has given the required two doses to less than 5% of its 950 million adults.Rural India is home to more than two-thirds of the country's 1.35 billion people. While urban areas account for a disproportionately large share of the confirmed COVID-19 cases, those concerned about the spread of the virus in the countryside say statistics undercount cases in villages, where testing is less comprehensive.The health system in several regions in India collapsed in April and May as the country reported the world’s biggest jump in coronavirus infections, increasing pressure on the immunisation programme.1/2Suresh Kumar, 43, ties up the hair of his wife Pramila Devi, 36, who is suffering from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), before taking her to a local government dispensary, at their home in Kaljikhal, in the northern state of Uttarakhand, India, May 23, 2021./File PhotoRead MorePrime Minister Narendra Modi's government offers vaccines to vulnerable people, healthcare workers and those aged over 45 for free. Since last month, individual states have also been expected to procure vaccines for younger adults, or to provide them commercially through the private sector.Poorer states say this leaves their residents more vulnerable. The eastern state of Jharkhand, where nearly all districts are categorised as poor, this week urged Modi to give it free vaccines for all age groups.In many states the doses for those under 45 are available mostly or entirely in urban areas. Some officials say this is intentional, as the infection spreads more easily in crowded cities.""It's because of high-positivity"" in urban areas, said Bijay Kumar Mohapatra, health director of the eastern state of Odisha, explaining the state's decision to prioritise cities.Major international and domestic firms such as Microsoft (MSFT.O), Pepsi (PEP.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Reliance Industries (RELI.NS), Adani Group and Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) have organised inoculations for their employees, in many cases in partnership with private hospitals. Most of these companies and the huge private hospitals that serve them are located in urban centres.Vaccination rates in rural areas have also been depressed because of patchier internet access to use the complex online system for signing up for shots, and possibly because of greater hesitancy among villagers than among city dwellers.""LUCRATIVE DEALS""India's Supreme Court criticised the government's handling of the vaccination programme this week and ordered it to provide a breakdown of shots given in rural and urban areas.""Private hospitals are not equally spread out"" across the country and ""are often limited to bigger cities with large populations"", the top court said in its order dated May 31.""As such, a larger quantity will be available in such cities, as opposed to the rural areas,"" it said. Private hospitals may prefer to sell doses ""for lucrative deals directly to private corporations who wish to vaccinate their employees"".Dr. Rajib Dasgupta, head of the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said the risk of inequity was that parts of India would build up immunity disproportionately.“It can leave the rural population relatively more vulnerable.”Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1

"Millennials Getting Too Old to Build Wealth In “almost every way measurable,” millennials are getting too old to build wealth, according to a new Bloomberg report. The oldest millennials – now around 40 – are financially worse off than previous generations and they’re only 80% as wealthy as their parents were at the same age. This demographic has been hit by two major recessions during what are traditionally peak saving and investing years. “They were 27-years-old when Lehman Bros. went bankrupt, and the Great Recession dug in when they should have been establishing themselves in the workforce,” writes Bloomberg’s Olivia Rockeman and Catarina Saraiva. William Gale, a senior fellow in the Economic Studies Program at the Brookings Institution adds: “The Great Recession knocked everyone for a loop. It caused unemployment. It caused slow wage growth. It made it harder to accumulate wealth.” Then, at a time when people typically move into higher-paying managerial roles, the nation’s economy was shutdown due to the “pandemic.” “In 2020, the U.S. economy contracted 3.5%; When the oldest Baby Boomers turned 40 in 1986, the U.S. economy expanded at a 3.5% rate.” Now, Americans are concerned about the diminishing value of the U.S. dollar more than ever before. Economist Peter Schiff of SchiffGold.com writes: According to Google Trends, searches for the word “inflation” hit the highest level since 2004 between May 9 and May 15. That’s as far back as the data goes. Google charts trends numerically and during that time period interest in “inflation” went all the way up to 100.“If you look all the way from 2004 until the end of 2020, pretty much all the searches were pretty consistent at about 50. And now, in the beginning of 2021, is where we shot up from 50 all the way up to 100. So, something changed in 2021 that resulted in all these people all over the United States deciding independently that they were going to search inflation.” Despite all this, one financial planner believes that millenialls can still “catch up.” “Bottom line: Are millennials behind? Yes. Can you catch up? Yes,” says Juan G. HernandezAriano of WealthCreate, a financial advising firm in Texas. “How? First and foremost, defining your goals.” “Once you define your goals: build a budget, improve that budget, diversity not only from an investment perspective but an income perspective.” Alex Jones breaks down critical intel regarding Covid-19 and the infamous Wuhan lab.",0,0

"Rights panel begins Colombia visit into possible abuses during protests Representatives from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (CIDH) met with Colombian officials on Monday ahead of a three-day visit to gather information about possible rights abuses during nearly six weeks of anti-government protests.Dozens of deaths and injuries, many blamed on security forces, were connected to the demonstrations. The death toll of 21 confirmed by the government does not match those of protest groups and rights organizations, which say dozens more were killed.The CIDH, an autonomous arm of the Organization of American States, met with Vice President and Foreign Minister Marta Lucia Ramirez, the human rights ombudsman, attorney general and procurator.The meeting with Ramirez also included Emilio Archila, the top official charged with implementing a 2016 peace deal, who is leading government negotiators at suspended talks with protest leaders.""We had a long and productive meeting, with lots of information, many questions by the commission,"" CIDH President Antonia Urrejola said in remarks with Ombudsman Carlos Camargo.""National human rights institutions like the ombudsman's office are always allies to the commission in their monitoring work and that's why this meeting was so important,"" Urrejola said.Camargo said his office had shared information on the human rights situation during protests.The CIDH will also meet with protest leaders, lawmakers and high court judges and collect testimony from victims of protest violence and their families.Urrejola did not elaborate in a later news conference on what recommendations the CIDH might make following the visit.""Once the visit is over, we will analyze all the information we've received and the listening spaces that were created and next week we will publish a public statement which will contain our observations and recommendations,"" she said.President Ivan Duque has said his government will ask Congress to approve more training and increased oversight of police. An umbrella national strike committee suspended negotiations because the government has not signed a pre-agreement reached late last month.Government negotiators say the pre-agreement was a draft and that the committee unilaterally ended talks, which covered everything from healthcare to a basic income.The government has repeatedly called for the strike committee to condemn road blockades, which have caused shortages and stymied exports.It is not within the remit of the CIDH to comment specifically on the negotiations, Urrejola said, but she urged Colombians to reach solutions through dialogue.Protests and roadblocks have cost the economy close to $3 billion, the Finance Ministry estimates, with barricades halting shipments of oil, coal and coffee, and increasing food prices.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Gangs raid police stations for weapons in Haiti as deadly violence surges Gangs raided multiple police stations for weapons in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, in deadly attacks over the weekend as violence between armed groups flared, with intense conflict in one southern neighborhood forcing thousands to flee.The gangs have proliferated in the poorest country in the Americas over the past few years during a period of political unrest and growing economic misery. Armed groups increasingly outgun Haiti's security forces and fight with one another over territory.The United Nations said on Sunday it was ""profoundly worried"" about the impact of the growing violence on civilians, recalling similar incidents over the past year that forced thousands to flee.Haiti is also facing a surge in COVID-19 cases and is bracing for a referendum at the end of June over a new constitution.Attackers raided six police stations over the weekend, killing three police officers and burning their bodies in one attack, local news outlets reported. In another, a police inspector who refused to hand over weapons was shot to death.The head of the national police, Leon Charles, confirmed two of the attacks and the inspector's death, telling a news conference on Sunday that authorities were intensifying efforts to combat the gangs.He said police had restored control of a highway leading south from the capital that had been blocked by gang warfare around the troubled neighborhood of Martissant since last Wednesday.The latest flare-up appeared to have killed about 10 people - including civilians - and forced thousands to flee the area as assailants torched homes and businesses, the office of civil protection said in a statement.Videos on social media last week showed bodies along the empty highway that was manned by gunmen. The videos also showed displaced people, including children, taking refuge in a church, in a market square and at a sports center.Fresh produce ran low in Port-au-Prince as trucks carrying supplies from the south were blocked.""The phenomenon of gangsterization is taking on more and more alarming proportions,"" the office of civil protection said, adding there were conflicts in at least three other neighborhoods of the capital.

Kelly asked Nunes to elaborate on a current lawsuit filed by Babbit’s family, saying Ashli’s death “was not nearly adequately addressed.” Devin Nunes is calling for the name of officer who shot Ashli Babbit to be revealed.

"Iran says nuclear talks policy won't change after presidential vote Iran's policy in talks with world powers to revive the 2015 nuclear accord will remain unchanged after a June 18 presidential election because the issue is decided by its highest leadership, a government spokesman said on Tuesday.A host of barriers to the revival of the nuclear deal remain firmly in place ahead of talks due to resume this week, suggesting a return to compliance with the accord is still a way off, diplomats, Iranian officials and analysts said.  read more ""We have shown that we adhere to our international obligations under all circumstances, and this was a national decision,"" cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei told a weekly news conference.Rabiei said Iran's nuclear policy, set by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is not linked to internal developments and that the new government would maintain the same policies as those followed in the Vienna talks which began in April.""As long as all parties to the nuclear accord abide by their commitments, they can be sure that Iran will not abandon its obligations,"" Rabiei said.Former U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018, prompting Iran to steadily overstep the accord's limits on its nuclear programme.With a hardline-led election watchdog barring leading moderate and conservative candidates, the turnout is likely to be low in seven-man race between hardline and somewhat less hardline candidates, and two low-profile moderates.The candidates took part in a televised debate on Tuesday and sparred on issues including ways of saving the nuclear deal and lifting U.S. sanctions that have devastated Iran's economy.The leading moderate candidate, Abdolnaser Hemmati, accused hardliners of seeking to heighten tensions with the West through a militant foreign policy, while conglomerates they control rake in large sums by circumventing sanctions.""I face a tendency which wants to turn the White House into a Hosseinieh (Shi'ite prayer hall) instead of developing Iran,"" said Hemmati, a former central bank chief.

The work of fighting fascism has always been our nation’s greatest project — in 1944 and today.Thanks to Brian Williams for marking #DDay on @11thHour with our new ad 👇 pic.twitter.com/S5i9ySQtqZ— The Lincoln Project (@ProjectLincoln) June 5, 2021 The propaganda piece was aired in commemoration of the 77th anniversary of the June 1944 Allied invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during World War II, also known as D-Day. Williams started the segment by describing D-Day, saying, “Over 150,000 men invading the French coastline under withering German fire to begin their march across Europe where they would go on to win WWII 336 days later.” Williams then pitched to the Lincoln Project video, which began, “Who is Antifa? They stormed the beaches of Normandy, parachuted into the French countryside and gave their lives to face down and fight back against fascism.” “They took down Nazi machine gun nests, tore apart the Third Reich’s strongholds, liberated concentration camps, liberated France, Italy, Belgium, Holland,” the montage continued. “Anywhere Antifa saw fascism, they fearlessly and relentlessly annihilated it. Fascism was defeated because of patriots like these, proud Americans who knew that the fight against fascists was not simply a battle between opposing nations, it was a war against inhumanity, a war that isn’t nice but cannot be lost, a war we still fight today.” Without a hint of irony, the video being aired on MSNBC ended by stating, “Antifascism, it’s not a cable news talking point, it’s an American ideal that should be memorialized because it was paid for in blood.” Equating a domestic terror group with some of the country’s most highly regarded veterans is a new low, even for MSNBC.

"Watch: Fauci Pal Daszak Admits “Chinese Colleagues” Developing “Killer” Coronaviruses Authored by Natalie Winters via TheNationalPulse.com, EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak – who collaborated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology on research funded by Dr. Anthony Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease – appears to boast about the manipulation of “killer” SARS-like coronaviruses carried out by his “colleagues in China” in a clip unearthed by The National Pulse. Daszak made the admission at a 2016 forum discussing “emerging infectious diseases and the next pandemic,” which appears to be at odds with Fauci’s repeated denial of funding gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. While describing how his organization sequences deadly viruses, Daszak describes the process of “insert[ing] spike proteins” into viruses to see if they can “bind to human cells” as being carried out by his “colleagues in China”: “Then when you get a sequence of a virus, and it looks like a relative of a known nasty pathogen, just like we did with SARS. We found other coronaviruses in bats, a whole host of them, some of them looked very similar to SARS. So we sequenced the spike protein: the protein that attaches to cells. Then we…Well I didn’t do this work, but my colleagues in China did the work. You create pseudo particles, you insert the spike proteins from those viruses, see if they bind to human cells. At each step of this you move closer and closer to this virus could really become pathogenic in people.“You end up with a small number of viruses that really do look like killers,” he adds. The comments follow growing evidence that Fauci’s NIAID has deep financial and personnel ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology – and that Daszak’s EcoHealth alliance was one of the primary proxies funneling the money to the Chinese Communist Party lab. Over a dozen research papers carried out under a $3.7 million National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) grant list the Wuhan Lab’s Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases Director Shi Zhengli as a co-author alongside Daszak.

"Mexican rulers' lower house majority to shrink, results show Mexicans pared back President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's power in elections on Sunday, an official projection based on early results showed, delivering his MORENA party and allies a reduced majority that will make sweeping change more difficult.The National Electoral Institute (INE) saw the ruling coalition winning between 265 and 292 of the 500 seats in the lower house, short of the two thirds majority needed to push through amendments to the constitution.The mid-term election was seen as a referendum on the president's policies and his shake-up of Mexico's institutions.The result, if confirmed, suggests voters want Lopez Obrador to tone down his plans to transform Mexico with an overhaul of politics and the economy. He has also toyed with constitutional changes to protect state energy companies.Since taking office in 2018 after a landslide victory, he has strengthened the role of the state in the energy sector and radically cut back on the cost of government to channel resources to the poor and his priority infrastructure projects.In the process, critics say, he has eroded institutional checks and balances and frequently criticized autonomous bodies, including the Bank of Mexico, prompting adversaries to sound the alarm about his concentration of power.The forecast outcome of the lower house election was in line with opinion polls late in the race, which showed Lopez Obrador's coalition losing some of its grip on the contest after a deadly metro accident in May and sexual abuse allegations against some of its most prominent candidates.Mexicans also chose 15 state governors and state lawmakers on Sunday. Results are still coming in. Opinion polls in recent days showed MORENA winning most of the 15 governors' races.'NOT HAPPY'The contest has taken place amid the COVID-19 pandemic and high levels of violent crime, with 91 politicians killed in this election cycle, according to security consultancy Etellekt.With security forces ramping up their presence in violence-plagued states Baja California, Guerrero, Michoacan and Sonora ahead of the election, crime was a top concern for many voters.In one incident on Sunday, a man threw a severed head at a voting station in the Terrazas del Valle neighborhood of the border city Tijuana as people voted. read more To stay on top in the long term, MORENA must improve its record on crime and the economy, officials, lawmakers and voters say. Mexico's economy contracted 8.5% in 2020, the most since the Great Depression of the 1930s, though it is now clawing back ground, lifted by U.S. demand. read more Olivia Aguirre, a 32-year-old academic in Mexico City who voted for Lopez Obrador in 2012 and 2018, said she was disillusioned with the president for his dismissal of women's protests against various problems including violence, a lack of support for renewable energy and what she called the ""authoritarian"" drift of his government.""I'm not happy about the direction the country is headed,"" she said after voting for the opposition in the city's Roma district.Many of her friends who had supported him felt the same way, though her parents still backed MORENA, she said.

"Stanford Epidemiologist: Fauci’s ‘Credibility Is Entirely Shot’ A Stanford epidemiologist called out Dr. Anthony Fauci for flip-flopping on numerous issues from the beginning of the global coronavirus pandemic. “I think his credibility is entirely shot,” Professor Jay Bhattacharya told Fox News’ “The Ingraham Angle” on Friday. Are Fauci's days numbered? pic.twitter.com/UiH46emz22— Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) June 5, 2021 “In the early days of the epidemic, he was quite a sensible person,” Bhattacharya said. “He understood immunity, he understood the necessity of not panicking the population. Something happened in late February where he just flipped on a dime.” “It wasn’t the science changing. Something else happened where he just changed,” he noted. Bhattacharya also criticized Fauci for making the “rookie mistake” of overestimating the COVID fatality rate. “He made a rookie mistake that no epidemiologist should make,” Bhattacharya said. “He conflated the case mortality rate with the infection mortality rate. There’s many, many times more people with infections of COVID than were caught, especially back then.” “It’s just an enormous mistake,” Bhattacharya continued. “And I think it’s really unfortunate that we have this person who just didn’t really have the expertise to lead the response, and yet we somehow we venerated him.” Fauci’s mask guidance is another example of his flip-flopping based on political, not scientific, factors. “Yes, you should change your mind when the science changes,” he concluded. “What is that science that changed that convinced him that masks are the most effective way?” Roger Stone joins The Bollingers on the War Room to ask, “Why have no Deep State agents been indicted?”",0,0
"Texas Bill Banning Tenets of Critical Race Theory and Action Civics Sent to Governor The Texas legislature has approved a bill that would ban the teaching of concepts associated with Critical Race Theory and “action civics.” The bill has now been sent to Gov. Greg Abbott (R). In an interview with Yahoo News published Friday, Texas state Rep. Steve Toth (R), the primary author of House Bill 3979, said the bill is in keeping with the message of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. “This bill is a direct reflection of the 1964 Civil Rights Act,” Toth said. “It echoes Dr. King’s wish that we should judge people on the content of their character, not their skin.” The bill prohibits teachers from discussing concepts related to Critical Race Theory (CRT), a Marxist philosophy that embraces the notion that all social and cultural issues should be viewed through the lens of race. The legislation particularly bans teaching or discussing the ideas that “one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex,” or that “an individual, by virtue of the individuals’ race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex.” The bill prohibits teaching that “an individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of the individual ’s race or sex.” Additionally, the measure states teachers cannot be forced to discuss current events in their classes. If they do so, they must “strive to explore the topic from diverse and contending perspectives without giving deference to any one perspective.” “The more people learn about critical race theory, whether Republican or Democrat, the more they oppose it,” Toth said. In another interview with the Houston Chronicle, Toth said CRT is “about profiling our children to promote strife and anger at one another and hatred.” The Texas lawmaker said that while the name of Critical Race Theory does not appear in the bill, what it prohibits are “prejudicial things that were outlawed in the 1964 Civil Rights movement, like discriminating against someone because of their race or sex.” Read more.",0,0
"Samoa's disputed leader promises Chinese-backed port at a third of the cost Samoa's disputed leader is promising to build a port with Chinese help for $100 million, about a third of the cost proposed earlier, said sources with knowledge of the initial plan, as he bids to stay in power despite losing a parliamentary majority in a tight election.The Asian Development Bank (ADB) deemed that the port project at Vaiusu, west of the capital Apia, was not economically viable after it was estimated it would cost more than $300 million, sources told Reuters.But the project's chief supporter, long-serving leader Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, told parliament recently a reworked version of the ""China-funded project"" would cost 250 million tala ($96.9 million) to build.Tuilaepa, a long-term ally of China, said the new port would create much-needed jobs and boost trade and tourism, while overcoming weaknesses at the main port in Apia, which is vulnerable to ocean swell.Opposition leader Fiame Naomi Mataafa, who was sworn-in as prime minister at an ad-hoc ceremony in May, told Reuters she would shelve the port development, calling it excessive for a small country already heavily indebted to China.  read more China has in recent years become a more assertive competitor for influence in the Pacific with the United States and its allies, which are wary of Chinese-backed infrastructure projects that could support military activity in hostile times in the strategic waters.Tuilaepa has not disclosed what financing arrangements have been discussed with China and which contractors may be involved. A spokesman for Tuilaepa did not respond to questions.The ADB said in a statement to Reuters that it found in a 2015 study that the Vaiusu plan was ""not economically and financially viable"".It instead recommended upgrading the existing Apia port, where work has been done with aid from Japan.The ADB declined to disclose costing data for the Vaiusu option.Three sources with direct knowledge of the ADB study, including one diplomatic official, told Reuters the Vaiusu project was projected to cost more than $300 million, raising concern it could tip Samoa into unsustainable debt should it go ahead.One of the sources said Samoa had sought help from China after the ADB declined to support the project.'NO STRINGS'The China-backed plan has a different wharf location, which reduces the amount of dredging required, compared with the ADB plan, thereby lowering costs. But one of the sources said that it was not clear how the new projected price could be reduced by two-thirds.The Vaiusu port would cater for container vessels, cruise ships and shipping fleets, and is in the final stages of negotiation with China with work set to begin when coronavirus restrictions on international borders are lifted, according to a January report in the Samoa Observer, citing Tuilaepa.China's foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, told a regular briefing in Beijing in May that Samoa had asked China to conduct a feasibility study for the port, and that any help would come ""without any political strings"".  read more China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to additional questions on Wednesday.China is the single largest creditor in Samoa, a country of 200,000 people, accounting for about 40%, or some $160 million, of its external debts.Samoa, meanwhile, has been at a political impasse since its April election.While a series of judicial rulings back Fiame's claim to be prime minister, Tuilaepa retains the support of the head of state, who has suspended parliamentary hearings and frustrated plans to confirm a new government.  read more The United Nations has urged Samoa's leaders to resolve the crisis through dialogue.($1 = 2.5694 tala)Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Scientists Discover Exoplanet With an Atmosphere Ripe For Study An international group of collaborators, including scientists from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and The University of New Mexico, have discovered a new, temperate sub-Neptune sized exoplanet with a 24-day orbital period orbiting a nearby M dwarf star. The recent discovery offers exciting research opportunities thanks to the planet’s substantial atmosphere, small star, and how fast the system is moving away from the Earth. The research, titled TOI-1231 b: A Temperate, Neptune-Sized Planet Transiting the Nearby M3 Dwarf NLTT 24399, will be published in a future issue of The Astronomical Journal. The exoplanet, TOI-1231 b, was detected using photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and followed up with observations using the Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS) on the Magellan Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. The PFS is a sophisticated instrument that detects exoplanets through their gravitational influence on their host stars. As the planets orbit their hosts, the measured stellar velocities vary periodically, revealing the planetary presence and information about their mass and orbit. The observing strategy adopted by NASA’s TESS, which divides each hemisphere into 13 sectors that are surveyed for roughly 28 days, is producing the most comprehensive all-sky search for transiting planets. This approach has already proven its capability to detect both large and small planets around stars ranging from sun-like down to low-mass M dwarf stars. M dwarf stars, also known as a red dwarf, are the most common type of star in the Milky Way making up some 70 percent of all stars in the galaxy. M dwarfs are smaller and possess a fraction of the sun’s mass and have low luminosity. Because an M dwarf is smaller, when a planet of a given size transits the star, the amount of light that is blocked out by the planet is larger, making the transit more easily detectable. Imagine an Earth-like planet passing in front of a star the size of the sun, it’s going to block out a tiny bit of light; but if it’s passing in front of a star that’s a lot smaller, the proportion of light that’s blocked out will be larger. In a sense, this creates a larger shadow on the surface of the star, making planets around M dwarfs more easily detectable and easier to study. Although it enables the detection of exoplanets across the sky, TESS’s survey strategy also produces significant observational biases based on orbital period. Exoplanets must transit their host stars at least twice within TESS ‘s observing span to be detected with the correct period by the Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC) pipeline and the Quick Look Pipeline (QLP), which search the 2-minute and 30-minute cadence TESS data, respectively. Because 74 percent of TESS’ total sky coverage is only observed for 28 days, the majority of TESS exoplanets detected have periods less than 14 days. TOI-1231b’s 24-day period, therefore, makes its discovery even more valuable. NASA JPL scientist Jennifer Burt, the lead author of the paper, along with her collaborators including Diana Dragomir, an assistant professor in UNM’s Department of Physics and Astronomy, measured both the radius and mass of the planet. “Working with a group of excellent astronomers spread across the globe, we were able to assemble the data necessary to characterize the host star and measure both the radius and mass of the planet,” said Burt. “Those values in turn allowed us to calculate the planet’s bulk density and hypothesize about what the planet is made out of. TOI-1231 b is pretty similar in size and density to Neptune, so we think it has a similarly large, gaseous atmosphere.” “Another advantage of exoplanets orbiting M dwarf hosts is that we can measure their masses easier because the ratio of the planet mass to the stellar mass is also larger. When the star is smaller and less massive, it makes detection methods work better because the planet suddenly plays a bigger role as it stands out more easily in relation to the star,” explained Dragomir. “Like the shadow cast on the star. The smaller the star, the less massive the star, the more the effect of the planet can be detected. “Even though TOI 1231b is eight times closer to its star than the Earth is to the Sun, its temperature is similar to that of Earth, thanks to its cooler and less bright host star,” says Dragomir. “However, the planet itself is actually larger than earth and a little bit smaller than Neptune – we could call it a sub-Neptune.” Burt and Dragomir, who actually initiated this research while they were Fellows at MIT’s Kavli Institute, worked with scientists specializing in observing and characterizing the atmospheres of small planets to figure out which current and future space-based missions might be able to peer into TOI-1231 b’s outer layers to inform researchers exactly what kinds of gases are swirling around the planet. With a temperature around 330 Kelvin or 140 degrees Fahrenheit, TOI-1231b is one of the coolest, small exoplanets accessible for atmospheric studies discovered thus far. Past research suggests planets this cool may have clouds high in their atmospheres, which makes it hard to determine what types of gases surround them. But new observations of another small, cool planet called K2-18 b broke this trend and showed evidence of water in its atmosphere, surprising many astronomers. “TOI-1231 b is one of the only other planets we know of in a similar size and temperature range, so future observations of this new planet will let us determine just how common (or rare) it is for water clouds to form around these temperate worlds,” said Burt. Additionally, with its host star’s high Near-Infrared (NIR) brightness, it makes an exciting target for future missions with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The first set of these observations, led by one of the paper’s co-authors, should take place later this month using the Hubble Space Telescope. “The low density of TOI 1231b indicates that it is surrounded by a substantial atmosphere rather than being a rocky planet. But the composition and extent of this atmosphere are unknown!” said Dragomir. “TOI1231b could have a large hydrogen or hydrogen-helium atmosphere, or a denser water vapor atmosphere. Each of these would point to a different origin, allowing astronomers to understand whether and how planets form differently around M dwarfs when compared to the planets around our Sun, for example. Our upcoming HST observations will begin to answer these questions, and JWST promises an even more thorough look into the planet’s atmosphere.” Another way to study the planet’s atmosphere is to investigate whether gas is being blown away, by looking for evidence of atoms like hydrogen and helium surrounding the planet as it transits across the face of its host star. Generally, hydrogen atoms are almost impossible to detect because their presence is masked by interstellar gas. But this planet-star system offers a unique opportunity to apply this method because of how fast it’s moving away from the Earth. “One of the most intriguing results of the last two decades of exoplanet science is that, thus far, none of the new planetary systems we’ve discovered look anything like our own solar system,” said Burt. “They’re full of planets between the size of Earth and Neptune on orbits much shorter than Mercury’s, so we don’t have any local examples to compare them to. This new planet we’ve discovered is still weird – but it’s one step closer to being somewhat like our neighborhood planets. Compared to most transiting planets detected thus far, which often have scorching temperatures in the many hundreds or thousands of degrees, TOI-1231 b is positively frigid.” In closing, Dragomir reflects that “this planet joins the ranks of just two or three other nearby small exoplanets that will be scrutinized with every chance we get and using a wide range of telescopes, for years to come so keep an eye out for new TOI1231b developments!” An international team of lawyers and medical experts are seeking to charge the CDC, the WHO, and the DAVOS group with crimes against humanity.",0,0
"Federal Judge Overturns California’s ‘Unconstitutional’ Ban On Assault Weapons Liberals are probably having a meltdown after a George W. Bush-appointed federal judge in California ruled the state’s ban on assault weapons is unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez of San Diego released a 94-page ruling late Friday, indicating California’s three-decade ban on assault weapons violates the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms. “Like the Swiss Army Knife, the popular AR-15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment. Good for both home and battle, the AR-15 is the kind of versatile gun that lies at the intersection of the kinds of firearms protected under District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008) and the United States v Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939),” Benitez wrote.“Yet, the State of California makes it a crime to have an AR15 type rifle,” Benitez continued. “Therefore, this Court declares the California statutes to be unconstitutional.” On several pages of the ruling, the judge recommended the rifle should be protected under the Second Amendment for its “militia readiness.” “Government is not free to impose its own new policy choices on American citizens where constitutional rights are concerned,” he added. “California may certainly conceive of a policy that a modern rifle is dangerous in the hands of a criminal, and that therefore it is good public policy to keep modern rifles out of the hands of every citizen. The Second Amendment stands as a shield from government imposition of that policy.” The office of Attorney General Rob Bonta released a statement after the ruling said it would immediately appeal the decision. “Today’s decision is fundamentally flawed, and we will be appealing it,” Bonta said in a statement Friday night. “There is no sound basis in law, fact, or common sense for equating assault rifles with swiss army knives.” The Firearms Policy Coalition, which supported the suit, praised the judge’s decision. “We look forward to continuing this challenge at the Ninth Circuit and, should it be necessary, the Supreme Court,” the group’s president, Brandon Combs, said in a statement. The outcome angered Gov. Gavin Newsom. He released a statement that read: “The fact that this judge compared the AR-15 — a weapon of war that’s used on the battlefield — to a Swiss Army Knife completely undermines the credibility of this decision and is a slap in the face to the families who’ve lost loved ones to this weapon,” he said. Benitez left plenty of time, about 30 days, for the attorney general to appeal, but we did find some irony in the July 4th date that the decision will take effect. Additionally, as Jonathan Turley noted, the decision could have some ramifications in the pending nomination of Chipman as Director of the ATF. Chipman is a former ATF special agent and senior policy adviser for the gun control organization Giffords. In his hearing, Chipman declared that “With respect to the AR-15, I support a ban as it has been presented in a Senate bill and supported by the president. The AR-15 is a gun I was issued on ATF’s SWAT team. It’s a particularly lethal weapon and regulating it as other particular lethal weapons I have advocated for.” Chipman was confronted on the definition of what constitutes an assault weapon. He told the Senate that the ATF defines an assault rifle as “any semi-automatic rifle capable of accepting a detachable magazine above the caliber of .22, which would include a .223, which is, you know largely the AR-15 round.” President Biden’s ATF nominee is eager to ban basically every single modern sporting rifle in America today. pic.twitter.com/iFrCUS6GYW— Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) May 26, 2021 That would include a wide array of weapons. Indeed, a statement by Judge Benitez may resonate with some senators: “This case is not about extraordinary weapons lying at the outer limits of Second Amendment protection. The banned ‘assault weapons’ are not bazookas, howitzers, or machine guns. Those arms are dangerous and solely useful for military purposes. Instead, the firearms deemed “assault weapons” are fairly ordinary, popular, modern rifles. This is an average case about average guns used in average ways for average purposes.One is to be forgiven if one is persuaded by news media and others that the nation is awash with murderous AR-15 assault rifles. The facts, however, do not support this The characterization of a finding as one of ‘fact’ or ‘law’ is not controlling. To the extent that a finding is characterized as one of ‘law’ but is more properly characterized as one of ‘fact; (or vice versa), substance prevails over form. hyperbole, and facts matter. Federal Bureau of Investigation murder statistics do not track assault rifles, but they do show that killing by knife attack is far more common than murder by any kind of rifle.” In fairness to Chipman, he made clear that he would enforce whatever the federal law prescribes in terms of any ban or the underlying definitions. However, he is viewed as an outspoken advocate for banning ownership of weapons like the AR-15, which was just declared as protected by this court. These are difficult policies and difficult cases. Reasonable people can disagree, including on the meaning of the Second Amendment. What is troubling is the level of misleading and frankly disingenuous discussion of the issue. The public is constantly being told that electing certain politicians will result in sweeping gun control when the current case law directly contradict such assertions. That was the case in the 2020 Democratic debates where candidates make unsupportable claims and promise. For example, now President Joe Biden attacked Senator Bernie Sanders over a vote that had favored the gun industry. Biden declared that, since the vote, 150 million Americans have been killed by guns. When people asked the campaign about roughly half of our population dying in gun violence, it said that number was probably more like 150,000. Nevertheless, many of the candidates promised massive changes. Biden declared “I want to tell you, if I’m elected NRA, I’m coming for you, and, gun manufacturers, I’m going to take you on and I’m going to beat you.” Beto O’Rourke ran on the issue and most famously declared “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.” Biden later declared that he would make O’Rourke a type of “gun czar” for his Administration. Such “hell yes” moments are likely to continue with the approaching 2022 election, but they may meet more judges who say “hell no” in constitutional challenges. Considering there was pro-Second Amendment black nationalists calling for the death of the white race, it isn’t how the reverse stance is taken by NPR regarding the Second Amendment and racism.",0,0
"Front-row view reveals exceptional cosmic explosion Scientists have gained the best view yet of the brightest explosions in the universe: A specialized observatory in Namibia has recorded the most energetic radiation and longest gamma-ray afterglow of a so-called gamma-ray burst (GRB) to date. The observations with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) challenge the established idea of how gamma-rays are produced in these colossal stellar explosions which are the birth cries of black holes, as the international team reports in the journal Science. “Gamma-ray bursts are bright X-ray and gamma-ray flashes observed in the sky, emitted by distant extragalactic sources,” explains DESY scientist Sylvia Zhu, one of the authors of the paper. “They are the biggest explosions in the universe and associated with the collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star to a black hole. A fraction of the liberated gravitational energy feeds the production of an ultrarelativistic blast wave. Their emission is divided into two distinct phases: an initial chaotic prompt phase lasting tens of seconds, followed by a long-lasting, smoothly fading afterglow phase.” On 29 August 2019 the satellites Fermi and Swift detected a gamma-ray burst in the constellation of Eridanus. The event, cataloged as GRB 190829A according to its date of occurrence, turned out to be one of the nearest gamma-ray bursts observed so far, with a distance of about one billion lightyears. For comparison: The typical gamma-ray burst is about 20 billion lightyears away. “We were really sitting in the front row when this gamma-ray burst happened,” explains co-author Andrew Taylor from DESY. The team caught the explosion’s afterglow immediately when it became visible to the H.E.S.S. telescopes. “We could observe the afterglow for several days and to unprecedented gamma-ray energies,” reports Taylor. The comparatively short distance to this gamma-ray burst allowed detailed measurements of the afterglow’s spectrum, which is the distribution of “colors,” or photon energies, of the radiation in the very-high energy range. “We could determine GRB 190829A’s spectrum up to an energy of 3.3 tera-electronvolts, that’s about a trillion times as energetic as the photons of visible light,” explains co-author Edna Ruiz-Velasco from the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg. “This is what’s so exceptional about this gamma-ray burst—it happened in our cosmic backyard where the very-high-energy photons were not absorbed in collisions with background light on their way to Earth, as it happens over larger distances in the cosmos.” The team could follow the afterglow up to three days after the initial explosion. The result came as a surprise: “Our observations revealed curious similarities between the X-ray and very-high energy gamma-ray emission of the burst’s afterglow,” reports Zhu. Established theories assume that the two emission components must be produced by separate mechanisms: the X-ray component originates from ultra-fast electrons that are deflected in the strong magnetic fields of the burst’s surroundings. This “synchrotron” process is quite similar to how particle accelerators on Earth produce bright X-rays for scientific investigations. However, according to existing theories it seemed very unlikely that even the most powerful explosions in the universe could accelerate electrons enough to directly produce the observed very-high-energy gamma rays. This is due to a “burn-off limit,” which is determined by the balance of acceleration and cooling of particles within an accelerator. Producing very-high energy gamma-rays requires electrons with energies well beyond the burn-off limit. Instead, current theories assume that in a gamma-ray burst, fast electrons collide with synchrotron photons and thereby boost them to gamma-ray energies in a process dubbed synchrotron self-Compton. But the observations of GRB 190829A’s afterglow now show that both components, X-ray and gamma ray, faded in sync. Also, the gamma-ray spectrum clearly matched an extrapolation of the X-ray spectrum. Together, these results are a strong indication that X-rays and very-high-energy gamma rays in this afterglow were produced by the same mechanism. “It is rather unexpected to observe such remarkably similar spectral and temporal characteristics in the X-ray and very-high energy gamma-ray energy bands, if the emission in these two energy ranges had different origins,” says co-author Dmitry Khangulyan from Rikkyo University in Tokyo. This poses a challenge for the synchrotron self-Compton origin of the very-high energy gamma-ray emission. The far-reaching implication of this possibility highlights the need for further studies of very-high energy GRB afterglow emission. GRB 190829A is only the fourth gamma-ray burst detected from the ground. However, the earlier detected explosions occurred much farther away in the cosmos and their afterglow could only be observed for a few hours each and not to energies above 1 tera-electronvolts (TeV). “Looking to the future, the prospects for the detection of gamma-ray bursts by next-generation instruments like the Cherenkov Telescope Array that is currently being built in the Chilean Andes and on the Canary Island of La Palma look promising,” says H.E.S.S. spokesperson Stefan Wagner from Landessternwarte Heidelberg. “The general abundance of gamma-ray bursts leads us to expect that regular detections in the very-high energy band will become rather common, helping us to fully understand their physics.”",0,0

Unlike Western countries, China has not been vocal in criticising the coup.A 'shadow government' named by the opposition was angered by a Chinese Embassy statement that referred to junta head Min Aung Hlaing as ""leader"" of Myanmar.The United Nations, Western countries and China all back ASEAN's effort to mediate in the crisis, which was triggered by the military's decision to end a decade of tentative democracy and international integration that it had itself initiated.But in taking back control, it has been unable to stop protests flaring up and down Myanmar. A rights group says government forces have killed at least 849 protesters, though the army disputes that figure.NEED FOR SHELTER AND FOODThe United Nations on Monday said those who had fled Kayah urgently needed shelter, food, water and healthcare, and urged security forces to let aid workers and supplies through.Kayah, which borders Thailand, is one of several regions where volunteer People's Defence Forces have attacked the well-equipped military, which has responded with heavy weapons and air strikes, triggering an exodus into nearby forests.Thailand, which fears a flood of refugees, has expressed its concern about the fighting and urged the junta to take the steps agreed with ASEAN.Images taken on Monday and obtained by Reuters showed a plume of smoke above the Kayah town of Mobye, which anti-junta militias were forced to flee after the army used heavy weapons, one fighter told Reuters.Reuters is unable to independently verify the accounts. State television made no mention of conflict in Kayah in its nightly newscast and a junta spokesman did not answer several calls seeking comment.Fighting has also taken place in the past few weeks in Demoso, Hpruso and the state capital Loikaw, where a resident described a climate of fear, with troops looting shops and questioning local people.""People are scared to go out,"" said the 25-year-old woman, who asked not to be identified for security reasons.""If people go out, soldiers stop them and interrogate them and sometimes shoot at them.""Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1

"Mexico bans influential ex-minister from holding public office A former Mexican senior Cabinet minister, Luis Videgaray, has been banned from holding jobs or positions in public service for 10 years for failing to properly disclose his assets while in office, the Mexican government said on Tuesday.The Public Administration Ministry (SFP) said it had applied the maximum possible sanction against Videgaray for making incorrect declarations for three years running during his time as finance minister and later as foreign minister.Videgaray, who was widely viewed as the most influential minister under Mexico's previous president, Enrique Pena Nieto, denied that he had made improper disclosures, saying on Twitter that he would appeal against the decision.Videgaray, who has rejected any allegations of wrongdoing, said in a statement the SFP had identified omissions in his asset declarations relating to bank accounts.Videgaray said these were in fact credit cards which he had mentioned in an annex to his declarations, and they had no outstanding debts on them at the time.""The declarations are correct and there was no intention to hide information about assets from the SFP,"" he said, adding that the SFP had acknowledged in the notification sent to him that he had obtained ""no benefit"" from the alleged omissions.The SFP later responded to Videgaray's remarks, saying that the omissions were bank accounts, which contained sums of money that should have been declared.The SFP said it had opened a probe in 2019 into Videgaray over his possible involvement in the 2014 purchase by state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) of a fertilizer plant known as AgroNitrogenados, which later caused a scandal.Asked publicly in February 2020 about his role in scandals in Mexico, including investigations relating to Pemex, Videgaray said that he had done good things and made mistakes as a policymaker, but that he stood by his track record. Videgaray was notified of the sanction on May 11, but the news was not made public until now due to the campaign for mid-term elections, which were held on Sunday, the SFP said.Mexico's government argues the plant deal wasted millions of dollars in public money and was tainted by corruption.The acquisition of AgroNitrogenados forms part of a broader investigation by federal prosecutors into allegations of graft under the Pena Nieto administration.President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador accuses the preceding administration of scheming to case the break up of Pemex to benefit private interests.The SFP said the sanction handed down against Videgaray was independent of any other investigations that may be under way.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Turkey offers to run Kabul airport after NATO's Afghan withdrawal -officials Turkey has offered to guard and run Kabul's airport after the United States and other NATO forces withdraw from Afghanistan, but U.S. officials say Ankara is imposing conditions which need to be resolved as their leaders prepare to meet next week.Turkish officials say Ankara made the proposal at a NATO meeting in May when the United States and its partners agreed a plan to withdraw troops by Sept. 11 after 20 years of war trying to defeat Taliban forces.  read more Turkish and U.S. officials have discussed possible requirements for the mission, some of which Washington has agreed to address, one Turkish official said.""Following the United States' decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, Turkey has made an offer to ensure the security of Kabul airport. In this framework, there are talks underway with NATO and the United States,"" the Turkish official said.A Turkish role securing the airport for international flights could help improve ties between Ankara and the West, sorely strained by Turkey's purchase of Russian defence systems and disputes with European countries over drilling rights in east Mediterranean waters.Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said on Monday that Ankara's offer was contingent on backup from those allies.""We intend to stay in Afghanistan depending on conditions. What are our conditions? Political, financial and logistical support. If these are met, we can remain at Hamid Karzai International Airport,"" his ministry quoted Akar as saying.U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they welcomed the Turkish proposal but that Ankara was asking for too many U.S. ""enablers"" for the mission.The officials also cited some U.S. concern about Turkey's reliability, given their other disagreements, but said Washington would find a way to make it work.NATO leaders will discuss Afghanistan at a summit next Monday, where Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan will meet Joe Biden for the first time since the U.S. president took office.With efforts to resolve the dispute over Turkey's purchase of Russian S-400 missile defences, which led Washington to impose sanctions on Turkey's arms industry last year, the airport plan may offer a rare opportunity to build goodwill.The two countries are also at odds over U.S. support for Syrian Kurdish fighters, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a U.S. court case against a Turkish state bank.ESCALATING VIOLENCEThe proposal comes as clashes over territory in Afghanistan raged, three months before the planned withdrawal. On Monday, senior government officials said at least 150 Afghan troops were killed or injured in a surge of attacks by Taliban militants in the previous 24 hours.Securing Kabul airport could help persuade some countries to maintain a diplomatic presence in Afghanistan. Last month Australia shut its embassy there due to security concerns.Turkey has more than 500 troops stationed in Afghanistan as part of a NATO mission to train Afghan security forces, and the Turkish official said additional troops would be needed for the airport mission.Talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban, which was ousted from power by a U.S. invasion in 2001 and has since waged an insurgency, have been shelved amid the withdrawal. Both sides have accused each other of provocations.The Afghan government and Taliban were not immediately available for comment. It was not clear whether the Islamist Taliban would accept an expanded Turkish mission.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Mongolia votes for new president amid COVID-19 campaign curbs Mongolia goes to the polls on Wednesday to choose its sixth democratically-elected president, with the ruling Mongolian People’s Party (MPP) on the cusp of consolidating its power following a low-key campaign crimped by COVID-19 curbs.The vote is the first after constitutional amendments stripped the office of some of its powers and limited holders to a single six-year term, so keeping incumbent Khaltmaa Battulga of the opposition Democratic Party from seeking re-election.Ukhnaa Khurelsukh, forced to resign as prime minister after protests this year, is the favourite to take over the presidency for the MPP, which already controls parliament and government.The Democratic Party is fielding Sodnomzundui Erdene to replace Battulga.Campaign events in the capital, Ulaanbaatar, have been kept to a minimum as it battles COVID-19. Daily infections hit a record over the last week and Mongolia's deaths stand at 325.""Because of coronavirus there is very little election campaign information, and I will probably decide at the time,"" said a 22-year-old voter, Ganbayar Gantulga.About 1,000 of Khurelsukh's supporters held a rally outside a concert hall on Saturday, but he moved his campaign online a few hours later after his Labor Party rival Dangaasuren Enkhbat, the third election candidate, tested positive for coronavirus.Mongolia's hybrid political system gives parliament the power to make laws and appoint governments, but it also gives the president a veto over legislation.Voters usually chose opposition party candidates as president. Although winners must relinquish party allegiance, they have tended to block legislation on party lines, creating political deadlock that some say has held back the country.Although businessman and former wrestler Battulgahe failed to overturn the decision to exclude him from this year's elections, he remains popular among some voters.""Battulga has done quite a lot for the people,"" said Tsetsegmaa Khasbat, a 67-year-old retiree. ""He is a person who can get things done.""1/5People observing social distancing amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic attend a campaign rally of Sodnomzundui Erdene, presidential candidate of the Democratic Party, ahead of the presidential election, in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia June 3, 2021.

"Israel says Gaza tower that housed AP doubled as Hamas electronic warfare site Israel's military said on Tuesday that a tower block in Gaza housing the U.S.-based Associated Press which was destroyed in an Israeli air strike was also used by the enclave's Islamist rulers Hamas as an electronic warfare site.Israel's destruction of the 12-storey tower, which also housed Qatar-based media group Al Jazeera, during last month's fighting with Hamas and other militants drew international condemnation and calls by Israel's main ally the United States to protect journalists.  read more The al-Jalaa building in Gaza City had been evacuated after its owner received advanced warning of the May 15 strike.

"Did Amazon’s ‘White Fragility’ Training Lead Worker to Assault White Woman For Her ‘White Privilege’? In the midst of the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos went before Congress to hail the “much-needed race reckoning” America was going through and reportedly hired Robin DiAngelo to teach employees about “white privilege” and “white fragility.” On Thursday, one of Amazon’s employees who appears to have been hopped-up on just such anti-white propaganda was filmed viciously assaulting an elderly white woman after reportedly telling her to “check her white privilege.” SHOCKING VIDEO shows an Amazon Driver giving a 67 year old Castro Valley woman a beat down after words were exchanged. 21 year old woman arrested by Alco Sherrif…who says suspect claims self defense. @kron4news pic.twitter.com/umTVNityDi— Maureen Kelly (@KRON4MKelly) June 4, 2021 From The Daily Mail, “Female Amazon delivery driver, 21, tells complaining 67-year-old woman customer to ‘check her white privilege’ and then viciously beats her after being called a ‘b***h’ in feud over delayed package”: A 21-year-old Amazon delivery woman viciously beat another woman, 67, who had called her a bi**ch after the San Francisco-area driver told her to ‘check her white privilege’ when she’d complained about a delayed package. Itzel Ramirez, the Amazon driver, was arrested after she was filmed assaulting the woman in Alameda County, the sheriff’s office said on Friday.[…] ‘I believe the Amazon driver said something about “your white privilege,” and my tenant said, “You don’t need to be a b***h about it,” turned around and walked away,’ [Apartment complex owner Doug Smith] told KTVU-TV.Ramirez was so enraged that she began punching the woman in the head and upper body, landing as many as 10 blows. WATCH: Twitter doesn’t know what side of history it actually wants to be on, denying Americans right to a politcal discourse, all while claiming Nigeria isn’t allowing them to be the “human right” all Nigerians deserve. As the report noted, the assailant is now claiming she acted in “self-defense.” I guess she was just defending herself against “white supremacy”! “Karen” was oppressing her with her “white privilege” just by existing! In 2018, Facebook announced they were going to start censoring “misinformation” that leads to “real-world harm.” “We have identified that there is a type of misinformation that is shared in certain countries that can incite underlying tensions and lead to physical harm offline,” Facebook said. “We have a broader responsibility to not just reduce that type of content but remove it.” They proceeded to go on a mass-censorship spree purging everyone who criticized mass immigration and other social media sites quickly followed suit. Are they going to ban misinformation about non-existent “white privilege” now that it can be plainly seen to be causing real-world harm? Of course not! Just six months ago, Facebook announced they were overhauling their “race-blind” “hate speech” algorithms to explicitly allow more anti-white hatred! This anti-white agenda is being pushed from the top down by the US government working in concert with the richest, most powerful and most privileged companies in the world! Rather than try to ridiculously argue “self-defense,” Amazon driver Itzel Ramirez should argue that she was just doing as she was trained!",0,0

"Trump Advisor Unveils ‘America First Legal’ To Take On Biden Lawlessness Former Trump adviser Stephen Miller announced a new legal initiative to combat the left’s lawlessness in a non-profit described as the “conservative response” to the far-left American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The group, called America First Legal, has already taken on the Biden administration over a range of issues from illegal immigration to racial discrimination and civil liberties. During a wide-ranging interview with CNS News on Friday, Miller described how America First Legal is addressing Joe Biden’s attempt to collapse the southern border in violation of federal law. “We are a brand new organization and the way that I summarize it for people is that we are the conservative response to the ACLU,” Miller told host Rob Shimshock. “And so we saw for the last four-plus years, how every time President Trump tried to advance a policy — a lawful policy, in the case of our administration — the left ran to a court, typically, you know, in a place like San Francisco, to try to get an injunction from a left-leaning judge and stymie our ability to effectuate conservative policy for the country. And there really isn’t any parallel to this or hasn’t been for conservatives.” “Of course, the most important distinction between what the ACLU is doing and what we, as a brand new organization are doing: they went to court to prevent the administration from engaging in lawful conduct; we’re going to court to try to stop this administration from engaging in unlawful conduct,” Miller noted. Miller went on to explain how America First Legal aims to hold Biden accountable to the law as written by Congress. “And really, it comes down to a fundamental question, which is: does a president have the authority to suspend by edict, laws that have already been passed and adopted and signed by a previous administration? The answer, of course, is resoundingly no,” Miller said. “There’s only one way a president can block law and that is before the law is enacted, he can veto it. It’s all spelled out clearly in the Constitution. He can veto a law, prior to enactment, when the bill is sent to his desk and if Congress cannot muster the votes to override it, then that law doesn’t, in fact, become law, or the bill does not become law. Once passed, a president has no authority whatsoever to suspend, rewrite, or nullify duly enacted law.” “So this really is a core constitutional issue about the president’s fundamental obligation in the Constitution to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,” he added. Miller went on describe how the left uses the law as a weapon to bludgeon their political enemies with rather than execute it in good faith. “And it’s really the heart of the divide in America right now, which is that the hard left views the law as simply an instrument to advance their own agenda and objectives. It’s just another tool,” Miller said. “In other words, it doesn’t have any inherent guidelines or structures built around it. It’s a sword; it’s a weapon. Wield it however you want, point it wherever you want, hurt whoever you want to hurt. In other words, they don’t think of it like ‘oh, we better have all these self-imposed restraints so we’re in power, not hurt anybody for political reason’; they say ‘no, if this is a tool we have then use it, just like the media is a tool, if Wall Street financing is a tool, if corporate America is a tool, then the law is a tool.'” This is the massive abuse of power coming out of Washington DC that is seeking to intimidate conservatives and law-abiding citizens across the country.",0,0

"In crackdown on fraud from Myanmar, China authorities target suspects' families Chinese authorities are trying to lure back fugitive fraudsters operating across the border in Myanmar by threatening to cut off pensions and other benefits for family members, according to social media postings by public security bodies.Since a Feb. 1 coup in Myanmar, economic collapse and lawlessness have created conditions for an upsurge in criminal activity, particularly in northern border areas and by Chinese gangs, according to a report from the United States Institute of Peace.Large-scale criminal groups have long operated in the region, much of it outside the control of the military junta, using it as a base for well-organised telecoms and internet fraud scams, as well as hosting illegal casinos.The actions by local authorities come after China's President Xi Jinping said in April that China will resolutely crack down on telecoms and internet fraud.According to notices from Chinese public security departments in at least five counties early this month, suspects in Myanmar face losing their household registration permit - a key document linked to residence and access to public services - if they don't turn themselves in, and would be unable to return to China.One county in Jiangxi province said it would seek to suspend pensions and medical coverage for the immediate relatives of 33 suspects, giving the names and addresses of the suspects. The notice was later deleted from WeChat.A county in Hunan province said social welfare guarantees for family members of suspects would be cancelled, while houses built using illicit funds would be destroyed and the people residing there would be expelled.The official People's Daily WeChat account reposted one of the notices.The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Public Security did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Much of northern Myanmar, where most of the notices said suspects were located, is under the control of militias, some of which are opposed to the military that seized power in a coup in February, while others support it or have remained neutral.""In the two months since the military reestablished its tumultuous rule, criminal activities in Myanmar have widened dramatically, posing new challenges to the region's efforts and ability to control cross-border crime,"" the United States Institute of Peace, a U.S.-government funded nonpartisan institute, said in its April report.Large tracts of northern Myanmar are also part of the Golden Triangle illicit drug producing region, while areas in the north and north-east that border China and Thailand have a proliferation of illegal casinos that law enforcement authorities say are used for money laundering.A television show released in China this year dramatised efforts by the country's police to fight transnational crimes- including telecoms fraud, committed by or against Chinese nationals abroad. One Southeast Asian region called ""Country M"" featured in the drama.In one 2019 telecoms fraud case involving 10 million yuan  ($1.56 million), Chinese police cooperated with their counterparts in northern Myanmar to bring back 69 Chinese nationals, according to the state-backed China Daily.Security experts fear that the collapsing economy and increased fighting between ethnic militias and the Myanmar military in the wake of the coup will see a surge in illicit activity to finance armed groups.

"Karma? Mark Zuckerberg Blasts Whistleblowers Who Expose Facebook’s ‘Censorship’ — in Leaked Video The news comes almost two weeks after two insiders revealed Facebook has allegedly been testing an algorithm on its users that demoted, buried, and hid comments, describing “potentially or actually true” events or facts. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has criticised company employees who expose the social media giant’s “alleged” censorship programme. Ironically, he made the remarks during a video chat, later leaked by a Facebook insider. The video was subsequently posted online by a non-profit investigative media outlet, Project Veritas. During the conversation with high-ranking Facebook officials, Zuckerberg stressed that the tech giant should be good “at rooting out people, who are leaking stuff”, lamenting that the company had suffered from numerous whistleblowers last year. “I’ve been clear that we have a number of efforts to find people and we terminate people and pursue the recourse that we have when we identify them”, Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg’s view on whistleblowers was echoed by Heidi Swartz, Deputy General Counsel of Employment Law & Investigations, who emphasised that all leaks – good or bad – are damaging to the company. “They’re not the right way to bring about change, especially in a company like this where people are free to share their opinion. You may think you’re leaking because you want to hold leadership accountable or that you’re on the right side of history, but that is very subjective and you may not have all the information to make that call”, Swartz said. Zuck really doesn’t get it does he? He can fire Morgan Kahmann, but more heroes will continue to step up. If you’re on the inside of a corrupt organization send me a DM or email us at [email protected] Let’s talk. pic.twitter.com/4C2N3WWfBe— [email protected]🇺🇸 (@EricSpracklen) June 5, 2021 The development comes two weeks after two Facebook employees shared internal documents with the investigative media outlet Project Veritas, showing that the company has been testing an algorithm on 1.5 percent of its Facebook and Instagram users worldwide. According to the documents shared with Project Veritas, Facebook essentially censored comments of users, who spoke of concerns about coronavirus vaccines. The social media giant wants to “drastically reduce user exposure” to vaccine hesitancy comments. Health experts and entrepreneurs have repeatedly drawn attention to the misinformation surrounding the coronavirus pandemic and vaccines, which they say may hamper the global fight against the infectious disease that according to Johns Hopkins University has already left 3.7 million dead. Yet, per the documents shared by the insiders, in its crusade against vaccine hesitancy Facebook was ready to censor comments that described “potentially or actually true events, or facts that can raise safety concerns”. Commenting on the exposure, Facebook said the company has informed users about its policy. “We proactively announced this policy on our company blog and also updated our help centre with this information”, said a spokesperson. One of the insiders, Morgan Kahmann, says otherwise. Speaking recently on the Fox show “Tucker Carlson Tonight” he said he believes Facebook’s actions are “highly immoral”. “The users at Facebook are not aware that this is going on and if you’re using Facebook or a social platform and they’re censoring the content of your comments unbeknownst to you”, he said. Kahmann, a whistleblower who leaked internal documents exposing “vaccine hesitancy”, revealed that he was fired by Facebook for “violating the company’s policy”.

"Make it easier to prosecute top Vatican clerics, financial watchdog urges A financial watchdog urged the Vatican on Wednesday to sharpen up its procedure for prosecuting senior clerics and hire more investigators with financial expertise.In a 275-page report on efforts to protect the city-state against the scandals that have plagued it down the decades, the monitoring body of the Council of Europe was broadly positive, giving only one unsatisfactory mark among about 50 ratings.Since the first Moneyval report nearly 10 years ago, the Vatican has made numerous changes in financial oversight and has overhauled its bank.""Internal control measures and procedures have significantly improved in recent years and the measures put in place are generally effective,"" the report said.In April, Pope Francis changed the law so that bishops and cardinals who work in the Vatican will be judged by the same lay tribunal that hears other criminal cases, not by an elite panel of prelates.  read more The new rules could affect Cardinal Angelo Becciu, whom Francis fired from a top Vatican post last year after allegations of embezzlement and nepotism.Becciu, who is also caught up in a scandal involving the purchase of a London property by the Vatican's Secretariat of State, has denied wrongdoing in both cases.  read more However, Vatican prosecutors still have to get the pope's permission to go after cardinals and bishops, much as parliamentary consent is needed in some European countries to indict legislators.Moneyval said this procedure should be set down in a transparent way, which would also ""provide a clear time frame for completion"".The report said both the Vatican prosecutor's office and its police needed more experts in financial crimes, but noted that two more prosecutors had been hired after the onsite evaluation on which the report was based.Moneyval also bemoaned the length of judicial procedures.The former head of the Vatican bank and two other defendants were convicted of embezzlement and money laundering this year after a three-year trial that followed a five-year investigation.Carmelo Barbagallo, head of Moneyval's Supervisory and Financial Information Authority (ASIF), said he was ""very happy with this assessment, especially considering where we were in the past"".Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"EU veto ‘hostage’-taking on foreign policy must end -Germany’s Maas Germany’s foreign minister said on Monday the European Union should abolish the right of individual member states to veto foreign policy measures as the 27-nation bloc could not allow itself to be “held hostage”.His comments, which came days after a more junior official criticised Hungary by name, reflect growing frustration in Berlin at the way in which EU member countries can prevent it from acting in matters on which almost all members agree.""We can't let ourselves be held hostage by the people who hobble European foreign policy with their vetoes,"" Heiko Maas told a conference of Germany's ambassadors in Berlin.""If you do that then sooner or later you are risking the cohesion of Europe. The veto has to go, even if that means we can be outvoted.""His remarks amount to a highly unusual rebuke by Germany of a fellow member state. Germany, conscious of its economic and political heft within the EU, is normally very cautious about being seen to throw its weight for fear of seeming overbearing.Hungary blocked an EU statement in April criticising China’s new security law in Hong Kong, undermining EU efforts to confront Beijing’s restrictions of freedoms in the former British colony. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday that the European left, led by the German left, was attacking Hungary because of ""its refusal to sign a politically inconsequential and frivolous joint declaration on Hong Kong"".These declarations make the EU look like a ""pathetic paper tiger,"" Orban wrote on his official website.""There must be an end to the preoccupation in Brussels with concocting and flaunting declarations. ... In recent years this common foreign policy approach, motivated by domestic political considerations, has led to the European Union's foreign policy stance becoming a laughing stock,"" Orban said.He said the EU's foreign policy should be decided by heads of states and governments instead of what he called bureacrats, citing the latest meeting of the European Council regarding Russia as a positive example.""As far as Europe's policy on China is concerned, we believe that we must prevent the reemergence of Cold War policies and culture in world politics,"" the nationalist premier added.Last month, Budapest refused to ratify a new EU trade and development accord with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and also declined to support an EU call for a ceasefire in violence between Israel and the Palestinians.Under Orban, Hungary has pursued closer ties with China, most recently agreeing to host a foreign campus of a Chinese university in Budapest over a chorus of opposition protest.

"Hungary appears to back-pedal on Chinese university plans after protests Hungary appeared to backtrack on plans to build a Chinese university in the capital Budapest after thousands took to the streets at the weekend accusing the government of cosying up to Beijing, provoking an angry Chinese response.Opponents of nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban fear the planned $2 billion campus could undercut the quality of higher education and help Beijing increase its influence in Hungary and the European Union.  read more A senior Orban aide said late on Sunday the university was not even at the planning phase, and once the plan took shape, in early 2023, it could be put to a referendum.""Once the project's conditions are known, we support a referendum in Budapest to decide whether locals want Fudan University here,"" Gergely Gulyas, Orban's chief of staff, told the pro-government news web site Mandiner late on Sunday.Orban, a self-styled illiberal, has built cordial ties with China, including massive joint business projects, and has several times this year blocked EU statements denouncing China's record on human rights, angering his allies.  read more According to media reports, the government was willing to pay for the construction of Shanghai-based Fudan University's first campus in Europe with a Chinese loan. The campus would displace a planned local student housing area.Public support for the campus is low, according to an opinion survey conducted last month, and Orban's ruling Fidesz party has weak support in Budapest, so a referendum could turn out against the project.Orban and Fidesz face their first competitive elections next year after three successive landslides since 2010. Opposition parties have united against Fidesz for the first time and caught up with them in polls.Political observers say Orban could decide to bide his time on Fudan and return to the idea after the election.""It is hallmark Fidesz to take two steps back to wait until the issue loses political steam, then attempt it again when it is more convenient politically,"" Political Capital analyst Peter Kreko said.Orban has abandoned unpopular projects before, such as a tax on internet traffic, a separate administrative court system and  plans to privatise marinas at Lake Balaton.OPPOSITION SPARS WITH CHINAGergely Karacsony, the opposition mayor of Budapest and a top contender to challenge Orban in elections next year, said on Saturday the university protest was a symbol of Hungarians rejecting heavy-handed government decisions.""Although we are worlds apart on human rights... we really just don't want a Chinese elite school built at the expense of Hungarian taxpayers,"" Karacsony told Saturday's rally.A media spokesman at the Chinese Embassy in Hungary, who did not give his name, criticised Karacsony's comments on the embassy's Facebook page.""In broad daylight, it is unseemly to criticize the internal affairs of another country, especially when I heard some key words in his speech, such as 'Tiananmen Square protests', 'democracy', 'human rights' and 'values',"" the official said.The Chinese embassy said it would address Reuters questions on a planned Fudan referendum at a later stage.Hungary blocked an EU statement in April criticising China's new security law in Hong Kong, undermining the bloc's efforts to confront Beijing's curbing of freedoms in the former British colony.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1

"Former Pentagon Official: U.S. Has Been Tracking UFOs for 70 YEARS Classified government documents soon to be made public show the United States has been tracking UFO crafts for 70 years, according to former Pentagon official Lue Elizondo. Elizondo made the bombshell revelation Friday on “Tucker Carlson Tonight”, noting that the long timeline essentially rules out the possibility that these advanced “tic-tac” aircraft belong to America, Russia, or China. “This is a document that was obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, and it demonstrates quite clearly that we have had issues with these UAPs [Unidentified Aerial Phenomena]…at least since 1950, probably earlier,” Elizondo told host Tucker Carlson. “And this is official US government correspondence. This isn’t some eyewitness report from a civilian. This is official government documentation from military personnel to very senior military brass.” Elizondo said the documents describe encounters with these aircraft “on a continuing basis” over “sensitive U.S. military facilities” with nuclear capabilities, and that the implications of the 70-year timeline reveal that these aircraft are not secret U.S. technology. “The U.S. government has finally admitted that this is not some sort of secret U.S. technology. But now there’s some wiggle room to say ‘well maybe it’s some sort of foreign adversarial technology,'” he said. “Here’s the problem with that theory: because we know that the Russians after the Berlin Wall came down, they shared a lot of information with us,” he continued. “There was this 5-year period or so, this new romance between us and Russia where they shared a lot of their UFO information with us. And by the way, they were seeing exactly the same thing in their skies that we were.” That leaves China as the only possible alternative, which Elizondo claimed is impossible when taking into account the state China was in during the 1950s: gripped in famine from the Great Leap Forward and with virtually no industrial technology. “You’re talking about a country that for somehow in 70 years, has kept this technology that was at least a thousand years ahead of us, kept it secret, was able to deploy it against us all the way back in 1950,” he noted, adding that encounters with these aircraft occurred more frequently once mankind entered the Atomic Age. It appears as if UFO technology is being made public.",0,0
"New York Politicians Have No Idea How to Fix the Subways The misery will continue for New York subway riders, who don’t understand how previous subway reforms have failed. State and city officials concede things will worsen. “There is no question our subways are in crisis after decades of underinvestment and inaction,” wrote New York City Comptroller Scott Stinger in a recent report. “The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA),” writes New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli in a report last year, “is facing its greatest challenge in decades.” Riders, he warned[,] “are abandoning the system for other transportation alternatives.” And the problems will continue for years. “Citing the MTA’s low debt service coverage in the near term and its challenging funding issues, Standard & Poor’s recently downgraded the MTA’s credit rating, which could lead to higher borrowing costs. Debt service is already projected to increase by 26 percent over the next four years, reaching nearly $3.3 billion by 2022,” according to the DiNapoli report. “Debt service,” DiNapoli wrote, “has been growing rapidly since the early 2000s.” Yet the red-ink woes of the government trains had been going on for many years before that. Stringer, who is critical of the subways but against any privatization, says bad subway service hurts the area’s economy. Losses range “from $170 million to $389 million” a year. And that was before the coronavirus crisis. Yet no state or city official says anything about bringing the private sector back into the subways. Its first lines were built by private companies, made lots of money, and helped clear slums in lower Manhattan as people were able to move to better neighborhoods. Yet the government-run subways, again on the verge of disaster, will follow the same solution even though it repeatedly failed over decades: More taxpayer money. Here’s what one subway historian wrote of the previous “give the subway more taxpayer money” plans: “If anything has emerged as a timeless and universal characterization of the New York Subway,” writes historian Brian Cudahy, “it is the endless search for some future salvation, some not realized resolution of its difficulties and cure for its ills. Plans are made, programs developed, goals established. But they never quite live up to their initial expectations, and a new cycle must begin.” Cudahy, who was also a former federal transit official, is against privatization. The MTA recently approved the biggest capital plan in the agency’s history; some $51 billion. MTA Managing Director Ronnie Hakim, promised that “enhancements” to the system would “improve the riders’ daily experience.” Dear Riders, Has Your Experience Improved? But most of this extra money, as the sad subway history repeats, will not be spent on better trains, but on servicing the huge amount of debt of the government agency running the system. For instance, how many people know that three separate Second Avenue Subway bond issues were approved over some 60 years—in the 1950s, 1960s, and recently under Gov. George Pataki—yet, in the case of the first two the money had to be spent on closing the subway deficit? As for the third bond issue, very little of the new line has been completed and who knows when this infamous Line—which was designed to replace the Second and Third Ave. els, which were taken down in the 1950s and 1960s—will ever be finished? Yet again the state agency that runs the subways, which in the 1960s replaced the city agency that made a mess of running them, says it is deep in the hole even with more money coming. The MTA, already in the midst of a new cash infusion, wants the federal government to provide billions more on top of that $51 billion, with service deteriorating and MTA officials saying the red ink could possibly lead to something I can’t recall ever threatened before in previous crises: Lines discontinued! Yet our political and media elites today have the same answer as 70 years ago: Give more money to this flawed system and ban the private sector. Actually, I would argue that, as with so many other failing government services in so much trouble, it is no longer a philosophical debate. Privatization is inevitable, given the messes created by decades of a government-run enterprise. Yet any privatization is verboten in New York’s increasingly socialist economy. Our leaders push various price controls. They are hostile to the privatization of anything. Impossibilities In the subways their opposition is based on a historical myth: “Private subways, private transportation companies, can never make money.” I have been told this many times. Is the private-transportation argument valid? No. The IRT [Interborough Rapid Transit Company] was a private management company that had a subway-franchise contract with the city. It built the first subways, which were considered “an engineering marvel” by Robert Caro in his biography of the controversial New York bureaucrat Robert Moses. “So superbly engineered and maintained had the system previously been that it took years for the systematic neglect to take its toll,” Caro wrote. But in the last decade or so of the IRT, the company that built the first subways did lose money and wanted to sell to the city. Why? The IRT, in its nearly 37 years of existence, was never permitted to raise the fare above a nickel. That fare was quickly and frequently raised once the city, and later the state, took over the subways. The use of price controls, along with punishing regulation, is the classic case of how socialism comes in the back door without anyone’s mentioning the word “Marx.” However, the journalists and political elites in our city either don’t know or want to hide some painful history about the subways. In the first 25 years or so of the IRT it made money—a lot of money. (By contrast, a government-run competing system, the IND [Independent Subway System], always lost money.) Indeed, in the IRT’s 1917 annual report, the transportation company reported net income of $23.2 million. That was an increase of about $1.5 million over the previous year. The IRT was also a good investment. It paid some $7 million in dividends, according to the annual financial report dated June 30, 1917. Profits and Dividends through Subway Operations? Yes. And even into the 1920s, when price controls and rising costs as a result of World War I squeezed profits, when the private operators sued to raise fares, the subways still made money. But the IRT could see problems coming. World War I had driven up costs and the nickel fare was insufficient. In a U.S. Supreme Court decision of 1929, Gilchrist v. IRT, a decision that affirmed that the five-cent fare couldn’t be raised to seven cents, court papers documented that the IRT was doing something that the government would never do: The IRT made money. “For the current fiscal year ended June 30, 1928, the figures for the first six months are available, and show a net surplus amounting to $3,687,000, which exceeds the surplus for the corresponding six months of the fiscal year before by $1,609,000.” However, after the IRT was repeatedly blocked from raising fares, the price-controlled subways lost money in the 1930s. Soon, we were on the track of a perpetual government-run system: It meant then what it means today and will always mean: Lose a lot and provide rotten service. But what if we continue down this same road of throwing more taxpayer geld down the sewer? More cutbacks and fare and tax increases will come in the current system as riders continue to suffer. Privatization is the only road back to the days when the subways were considered an engineering marvel. The subway system could and should be handed back over the private sector. It doesn’t have to be this way, a way in which people despair of having to ride this state-run nightmare. In fact, there was a time when the subways were great under a private management company. The people who run the city don’t want people to ever know that. They don’t want them to ever learn the true history of markets, which consistently provide better services than the government. They will then want—perhaps even demand—a privately owned, privately run subway system.",0,1

"Muslim neighbourhoods in British towns are ‘no-go areas’ for white people, new book claims An academic who studied Muslim integration in Britain has revealed in a new book that women and children in some communities are subjected to Taliban-like rules, and non-Muslims face threats of violence. Ed Husain, professor at the Walsh School of Foreign Service in Georgetown University, visited mosques across Britain, speaking to businesses owners, imams and locals about life in predominantly Muslim neighbourhoods. He used his on-the-ground research to write a book, ‘Among The Mosques: A Journey Across Muslim Britain’, which is set for release next week. The Muslim author grew up in a Bangladeshi family in London and was radicalised in his youth before renouncing extremism. According to the professor, integration issues in the UK continue to persist. One man in Blackburn told Husain that “Asian” teengers repeatedly “jumped” his 12-year-old son simply for “being white.” Another local told the author that certain parts of the town had become “no-go areas.” Blackburn has the largest Muslim population in the UK outside of London, and is a major hub for ultra-orthodox Islamic sects. Husain also learned that one school in the town had barred girls from participating in swimming lessons, saying that it was inappropriate for them to be seen in bathing costumes. While visiting a bookstore in Blackburn, the author stumbled across several volumes advocating strict restrictions and dress codes for women, as well as copies of a book which argued that it is sinful to enjoy dancing and listening to music. The town also reportedly has restaurants that provide gender separation for their clientele. While visiting Bradford, Husain was amazed by how few white residents there were, and was reportedly told by a taxi driver that they had “gone with the wind.” He noted that mosques were on nearly every corner and that even private homes served as places of worship and religious schools. The professor also learned that some Muslim parents in the area had prohibited their children from going to drawing and dance lessons. An imam in the city confided that there was “widespread abuse of disabled children in the Muslim community,” and that parents were pocketing social welfare money while neglecting their children. In Didsbury, the author came across a sign for a local ‘Sharia Department’, which deals with marital issues and other disputes through the lens of Islamic law. He reported similar interactions and situations in places like Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow. One woman told him that some Muslim communities in the UK had become a “different universe” from the rest of the country. Like other European countries, the UK has struggled with integrating immigrants from Muslim-majority nations, sparking concern about radicalisation. At the same time, reports suggest that there is a rise in anti-Muslim sentiment in the country. During Husain’s trip to Bradford, a local predicted that anti-Muslim sentiment could lead to “an apartheid city” within 30 years and give rise to Nazi-like political parties that would persecute immigrants.",0,0
"Soaring Used Car Prices May Result In “Shocking” Inflation Report Next Week Used car prices in the US continue to surge due to both the country’s economic recovery and an ongoing supply crunch. There are two components to watch in the core inflation report due next week. First is, and most importantly, are used car prices and second is the rent of shelter. Core inflation in April saw a more significant contribution to used car prices pushing inflation upwards of 2% YoY mainly because prices of used vehicles on the month jumped 21% YoY. For those who haven’t seen what is going on in the used car space, here is a chart of the Mannheim used car index: As the great reset agenda rears it’s ugly head into the public eye, the organization itself is poised to leverage AI to track and target all that stand in their way. “Prices on used vehicles increased by an astonishing 21 % YoY in April (contributing 0.8% to the yearly change in core inflation). According to Manheim Consulting, prices on used cars and trucks are expected to climb further to 50 pct YoY in May or June (3 months lag). If we assume a 50% yearly increase in used cars in May (Manheim may exaggerate the yearly price increase a bit), then core inflation will potentially surpass 4%. Supply chain disruptions, shortage of semiconductors and Covid-19 restrictions have all played a part in disturbing the price action in the car market, but bottlenecks are not always the root cause of inflation – they can also be seen as a symptom,” said Nordea. This means that the May inflation report next week (due June 10) could be an absolute shocker. “We see clear risks of a big positive surprise to the May inflation report as well with core inflation around or just above 4%. The market is still buying the transitory inflation narrative but for how long? Lately, increasing (US) inflation has been the main concern of markets,” Nordea said, adding that, “We are likely in for another inflation shocker in June, but the question is whether the market will explain it away as a transitory effect.” Peering into the real world, Financial Times speaks with people within the industry and in financial markets about what’s fueling used car prices. Carey Cherner, a 36-year-old used car dealer in Maryland, sold a 2001 Ford F-150 pick-up truck with close to 200k miles for $7,500, more than 50% higher than pre-pandemic prices. “There are more people buying cars than there are cars in the market, which makes it go kind of crazy,” Cherner said. Policymakers, such as Federal Reserve members, continue to soothe the market with the word “transitory” almost daily, as a form of a communication tool to admit there are inflationary pressures but avoid market participants from panicking. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, said earlier this week that used car cost pressures “may persist over the summer months, I expect them to fade and likely reverse somewhat in subsequent quarters”. But the problem here is that policymakers have been telling us that these pressures are “transitory” for months and keep pushing out the goalposts of when they want everyone to believe inflation diminishes. Nathan Sheets, the chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income and a former under-secretary at the US Treasury, said there is an “unprecedented level of stimulus plus other forms to support spending” floating around the economy. A combination of helicopter drops by the federal government and supply chain disruptions resulted in the quickest “V-shaped” recovery that ultimately sparked supply constraints, driving up prices. “How sure am I that I am right that inflation is going to dissipate? Probably 80 percent, but that is still a pretty fat tail,” Sheets said. “It’s incredibly tight right now: you have more demand . . . that is supported by fiscal stimulus, so it’s just like a perfect storm. And we see that clearly in prices,” said Laura Rosner, a senior economist at MacroPolicy Perspectives. But Jonathan Smoke of Cox Automotive, a consultancy for automobile dealers, noted that “several leading indicators of what’s happening at our auctions” suggest “the price appreciation streak is likely going to end.” However, in Maryland, Cherner doesn’t believe there will be a “steep drop-off [in prices] until there’s way more supply than there is demand. They [automakers] still have to build the new cars and get the chips in them and get them out. I just think it’s going to last.” So the main driver in next week’s inflation report will most likely be surging used car prices, and the red hot numbers may cause the Fed to start tapering or at least continue to communicate a future wind-down of its emergency pandemic policies this summer.",0,1

"Russia’s $186 Billion Sovereign Wealth Fund Dumps All Dollar Assets Following a series of corporate cyberattacks that American intelligence agencies have blamed on Russian actors, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund (officially the National Wellbeing Fund) has decided to dump all of its dollars and dollar-denominated assets in favor of those denominated in euros, yuan – or simply buying precious metals like gold, which Russia’s central bank has increasingly favored for its own reserves. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov made the announcement Thursday morning at the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. “We can make this change rather quickly, within a month,” Siluanov told reporters Thursday. He explained that the Kremlin is moving to reduce exposure to US assets as President Biden threatens more economic sanctions against Russia following the latest ransomware attacks. The transfer will affect $119 billion in liquid assets, Bloomberg reported, but the sales will largely be executed through the Russian Central bank and its massive reserves, limiting the market impact and reducing visibility on what exactly the sovereign wealth fund will be buying. “The central bank can make these changes to the Wellbeing Fund without resorting to market operations,” said Sofya Donets, economist at Renaissance Capital in Moscow. “This in some sense a technical thing.”Jordan Rochester, currency strategist at Nomura International PLC, said, “This is a transfer of euros from the central bank to the wealth fund, we’ll then see the central bank the holder of the USDs and it’s up to them to manage it. No initial market impact.” How oppressed are you when every major western capitol city is blanketed with your flag? The news isn’t a complete surprise: The Bank of Russia, Russia’s central bank, has steadily reduced its dollar holdings over the last few years amid increasing sanctions pressure from the US and Europe. That trend continued through President Trump’s term. Just a few days ago, we reported that the Russian parliament had just authorized the sovereign wealth fund to buy gold through the central bank. However, the central bank reports its holdings with a six-month lag, making it impossible to determine its current holdings. Russia’s gold holdings eclipsed its dollar reserves last year despite a halt in gold purchases. This was partly due to an increase in the value of its gold holdings with the rise in gold prices, and partly a function of the central bank’s continued efforts to shed dollar assets. The wealth fund currently holds 35% of its liquid assets in dollars, worth about $41.5 billion, with the same amount in euros and the rest spread across yuan, gold, yen and pounds. After this latest change, the fund’s assets will be held 40% in euros, 30% in yuan, 20% in gold and 5% each in yen and pounds, Siluanov said. Source: Bloomberg The wealth fund holds savings from Russia’s oil revenues above a cutoff price and is used to help offset shortfalls when the market falls below that level. Together with illiquid assets, its total value is $185.9 billion. A few years ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that Washington was inadvertently accelerating de-dollarization with its aggressive financial sanctions, which were forcing its geopolitical adversaries to reduce their dependence on the greenback. Just last month, Russia reached a new milestone whereby fewer than 50% of its exports were paid for in dollars. Dedollarisation is inevitable as the US attempts to assert itself to prevent it's accelerating decline. Thus speeding up the attempts by Russia, China and others to remove themselves from the dollar. https://t.co/TeEO4K974A— Red Star Radio (@Red_Star_Radio) June 3, 2021 It appears that after years of steadily reducing its dependence on the dollar, Russia is about to intensify those efforts in a way that Washington will be forced to take notice.",0,1

In it I noted an odd trend which many of us in the liberty media have become aware of over the years – Almost every major man-made catastrophe in the US and in many other parts of the world in the past couple decades has been preceded by a government or globalist “exercise”. These exercises and war games tend to mimic the exact disaster that would eventually strike the public only days or weeks later. Sometimes the mock disaster exercises and the real events happen at the same time. The covid pandemic was no exception. It’s quite miraculous… I have specifically outlined the bizarre “coincidence” of the World Economic Forum’s Event 201 exercise, a war game co-funded by Bill Gates and Johns Hopkins and launched in October of 2019. Event 201 simulated a global novel zoonotic coronavirus pandemic (supposedly spread from bats to people) that “required” a global lockdown response. Only two months later the real thing actually happened. Almost every aspect of the Covid event has played out exactly as was practiced during the WEF war game. One very disturbing element of the covid response has been the coordinated suppression campaign by Big Tech platforms from YouTube to Facebook and Twitter. This campaign has sought to undermine or destroy any facts, data and opinions which run contrary to the government narrative on covid, even if the official narrative on covid ends up being completely wrong. The strategy was described in detail during Event 201 and it was executed with extreme efficiency among supposedly disconnected companies and governments around the world. It’s almost as if they KNEW a coronavirus pandemic was about to happen, and they were already staged to control the public reaction well in advance. And let’s be clear because I do not want to seem ambiguous; the World Economic Forum and their globalist partners have been the prime beneficiaries during the pandemic. As WEF head Klaus Schwab has excitedly noted over and over again, the pandemic is a perfect “opportunity” for globalists to fast track what they call the “Great Reset” agenda – A plan to completely dismantle the current political and economic framework of the world and rebuild it into a highly centralized socialist civilization in which they are in complete control and personal freedom is a faded memory. This is why recent revelations of Covid’s probable lab origins are not at all surprising. Just mentioning this idea a year ago in social media was enough to get you banned. And, if you want to know where to find the truth, always look first to the subjects you are not allowed to discuss. As I stated in my article ‘How Viral Pandemic Benefits The Globalist Agenda’, published in January of 2020 at the very beginning of the outbreak: “I have a hard time ignoring the strange “coincidence” of the high level biohazard labs in Wuhan in favor of the idea that the virus was launched by chance due to the odd diets of central Chinese people. Given the evidence it appears that the coronavirus was gestated in a lab, not in someone’s bat and snake soup. In 2017, scientists outside of China warned that these labs were not secure and that a virus might escape one of the facilities…..I would use the term “escape” loosely, as there is a possibility that this event was created intentionally…” Elites like Dr. Anthony Fauci (a close associate of Bill Gates and Bill Gates SR.) directly funded studies at the Wuhan Lab through the NIAID since 2015, and specifically funded the study of the infectious transfer of coronaviruses from bats to other mammals including humans. And yes, the NIAID was in fact involved in “gain of function” experiments using SARS and coronavirus variants at this time, despite Anthony Fauci claiming otherwise. The National Institute Of Health’s own website confirms this. All of these facts support the argument that covid is a lab created bioweapon, and in my view according to the evidence so far it was released deliberately in close alliance with the Chinese government. Fauci even somehow “predicted” in 2017 that Donald Trump would face a “surprise infectious disease outbreak” during his presidency, stating that “We will definitely get surprised in the next few years…” The scheme has certainly worked to an extent. In large portions of Europe, Asia and Australia the WEF is getting what it always wanted. That said, some things did not go as planned. For example, Event 201 predicted an initial 65 million people dead within the first year of the pandemic; this did not happen, and it was not because governments saved any lives. In fact, government lockdowns and restrictions did nothing to stave off the spread of covid and independent studies have proven mask mandates to be completely ineffective in stopping the virus. The reason for the comparatively small body count is the fact that Covid’s death rate is only 0.26% among otherwise healthy people. The only place wear covid is a true threat is in nursing homes among elderly people with preexisting conditions. Because of the miscalculations of the elites, the reset agenda appears to be failing in some parts of the world. In the US, resistance to the lockdowns as well as the experimental vaccines has grown exponentially to the point that dozens of states are now passing laws which prohibit enforcement of covid restrictions and “medical passports”. The alternative media has also proven resilient against censorship and information suppression, and we have been proven to be right time and time again. We were the first people to warn that the death rate of covid was being exaggerated (the WHO and other establishment institutions predicted a death rate of at least 3%, FAR above the reality). We were the first people to warn that the lockdowns and mask rules did nothing to stop the spread (states that removed restrictions ended up with FALLING infections and deaths). And, we were the first people to warn that the virus was behaving more like a bioweapon, and that its origin was more likely the Level 4 lab in Wuhan, China, right down the street from the animal market that the Chinese government originally claimed was the source of the outbreak. We were also the first people to warn that the pandemic would be used as a rationale for the enforcement of vaccine passports, which would create a two tear society designed to force people who do not want to take the mRNA vaccines into compliance. We have been proven right once again as the state of Oregon has become the first in the US to demand proof of vaccination (a passport) before residents are able to enter any businesses or establishments. We have consistently been called “conspiracy theorists” throughout this event by government bureaucrats and the media. But, we were were right about almost everything, and the mainstream media has been wrong about almost everything. Either that, or they have been knowingly lying about almost everything. This dynamic is important to understand because I believe the situation is far from over and that more crisis events are about to be engineered (or they will magically happen by coincidence). My biggest concern right now is the upcoming ‘Cyberpolygon’ exercise being headed by the WEF this July. The war game is meant to “simulate” a cyberattack on vital infrastructure that would lead to a shutdown of the global supply chain, or at least the supply chains within certain nations. As I warned in April, the timing of Cyberpolygon is suspicious. As the covid lockdown agenda is breaking down in the US and the vaccine passports are not winning favor among a large percentage of Americans, the globalists will need another crisis even if they hope to achieve their goals for their Great Reset. Only weeks after I published my initial concerns about Cyberpolygon, a massive cyberattack was reported which struck the 5,500 mile Colonial Pipeline. The pipeline supplies gasoline to most of the eastern seaboard and after a week of being shut down numerous states were reporting gas shortages. The story has since quietly faded from mainstream news cycles. In the past few days, yet another major cyberattack has been reported against JBS, a meat company that supplies around 23% of all US beef and pork. Production at JBS has shut down, and now there is the possibility of meat shortages across the country if the problems are not solved soon. Again, is it just coincidence that these large scale cyberattacks are happening with greater frequency in the lead-up to a WEF’s Cyberpolygon simulation? Or, is Cyberpolygon another Event 201? Is it a beta test for a disaster that is planned for the near future? The WEF is openly comparing future cyber attacks to covid outbreaks, so I’m inclined to suspect the latter. The supply chain issue has come to the forefront in the wake of the pandemic as retailers have had to deal with intermittent shortages, and manufacturers are facing a lack of components. Not only that, but inflationary troubles are also weighing on supplies. That said, a cyberattack is another animal entirely; whether or not the event is real or staged, the supply chain is fragile because of global interdependency. In the US, there are many necessities that rely on foreign manufacturers or the “just in time” freight system. Preparedness and long term storage are not a part of the vocabulary of the common US business. I don’t really know if the supply chain could be shut down completely using a cyberattack, but in combination with inflation and draconian pandemic restrictions, it is possible to disrupt the flow of goods for weeks at a time. It is also impossible to predict how many people are prepared for such a calamity. My hope is that more than 30% of Americans have at least begun the path to prepping, but undoubtedly a majority of the country has not. All it would take is a couple weeks of shortages or a grid down scenario and most people would be facing starvation, among other things. If Event 201 is any indication, then we should remain vigilant and watch carefully for another major cyberattack affecting the supply chain within two months of the WEF’s Cyberpolygon exercise in July.

"Singapore's death toll from COVID-19 tops casualties in SARS outbreak Singapore has reported its 34th death due to COVID-19, taking its toll from the pandemic beyond the 33 casualties recorded during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak.The city-state was one of the worst-hit countries by SARS outside mainland China, based on numbers of infection and death, according to the World Health Organization's data.SARS, a previously unknown infectious disease, is believed to have emerged from the wet markets of China's Guangdong province before spreading into major cities. Globally, as many as 774 people died in the epidemic that reached nearly 30 countries.While the current pandemic death toll has exceeded Singapore's death toll from the SARS outbreak, the city-state still has one of the world's lowest COVID-19 fatality rates.Singapore authorities had said at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that the experience dealing with SARS meant they were more prepared for the COVID-19 outbreak.So far, Singapore has reported 62,219 COVID-19 infections since January last year, while it recorded 238 SARS cases between March and May 2003.The 34th COVID-19 death in Singapore was an 86-year-old woman who had not been vaccinated against COVID-19 and had a history of comorbidities including diabetes and hypertension, Singapore's health ministry said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Houston Methodist Hospital Orders Staff to Withhold Adverse Reactions Caused by Covid Vaccines from Official Records (Natural News) Jennifer Bridges, a nurse at Houston Methodist Hospital, has come forward with more information about her employer’s criminal attempts at suppressing the truth about the dangers of Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccines. Bridges told Del Bigtree during a recent episode of The Highwire that she and her coworkers at Houston Methodist are now forbidden from logging any adverse reactions to Chinese Virus injections on the company’s official records. “Every time a nurse or another employee comes out with an adverse reaction, they basically tell them in the ER … ‘No, it’s not an adverse reaction. This is just an intolerance.’ And they don’t report it properly and they don’t address it properly,” Bridges explained. “And I’ve actually been in contact with somebody in the hospital system that deals with, like, the charting and the finalization of people’s charts … They have told me that officially Methodist has told them, ‘Do not list any adverse reactions on anybody’s chart related to the vaccine.’” Houston Methodist was also in the news recently for a lawsuit that was filed by at least 112 of its employees who say they are being unlawfully coerced and threatened into getting jabbed as a condition of employment. “People are being told to not talk about this, not address it, and not label it on charts,” Bridges says about Houston Methodist’s fascist behavior. “As employees, [we] have to go to the system and document these adverse reactions because Methodist is not doing it.” You can watch a clip of Jennifer Bridges talking to Del Bigtree about Houston Methodist’s illegal covid vaccine mandate below: Houston Methodist, Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates are All Guilty of Crimes Against Humanity Meanwhile, the Chinese Virus house of cards is crumbling by the day as more revelations from the Fauci Emails emerge, painting a picture of total corruption, fraud and crimes against humanity hinged on the back of a global “pandemic.” If Houston Methodist does not take a step back from its medical fascism crusade, it could soon find itself on the wrong side of history facing the same potential punishments that Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates and the other successors of Josef Mengele who are in clear violation of the Nuremberg Code may soon face. Does Houston Medical’s leadership really want to face possible war crimes charges concerning these fake “vaccines?” Do they really want to find themselves mired in litigation as they continue to drag their reputation through the mud with each passing day? This writer would certainly never get an operation there, as who knows what kind of medical “accident” might occur under that type of leadership. Who in his right mind would ever put his life in the hands of medical personnel who see nothing wrong with discarding the Hippocratic Oath while lying about the damaging effects of experimental gene therapy injections? “Their boss claims 99% compliance on the shot-taking. 99%? Seems high. What did they do to get that, if true? We know there were adverse events,” wrote one commenter at National File. “They are required to report them but choose not to? How does an employer keep 26K employees in line? Oh yeah, they kick them out.” “This covid madness continues to ruin people’s lives, one way or the other,” this same person added, emphasizing the ridiculousness of all the Chinese Virus nonsense. “All shots (vaccines) are not alike and frankly, neither adults nor kids need most of the ones they want to push on the population, but especially this deadly Covid-19 stuff.” More related news stories about the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccines and medical fascism can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.

"Scientist At Center Of Lab Leak Controversy Put In Charge Of The Lancet’s Task Force To Investigate Virus Origin Revered scientific journal The Lancet has created a ‘task force’ to investigate the origins of the coronavirus that caused a global pandemic, yet it has decided to employ as its leader the very guy who funded the dangerous gain of function research at the Wuhan lab and subsequently allegedly ‘bullied’ other scientists into avoiding looking into the lab as a potential source of the outbreak. In the wake of renewed scrutiny of the lab leak hypothesis, the Lancet’s task force will reportedly “focus on analyzing data on all of the theories put forward on the origins of COVID, on the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 was able to break out of Wuhan and spread globally, and on the most plausible strategies to prevent future pandemics.” It also states that “The Task Force will review thoroughly and objectively all publicly available evidence, particularly the peer-reviewed literature, and conduct interviews with key leaders in science, medicine, policy and civil society.” ‘Objectively’. Right. Dr Peter Daszak, who is heading up this task force, is perhaps the least suitable scientist on the planet to objectively analyse the data, given his track record. Daszak, as President of the EcoHealth Alliance, shovelled at least $600,000 to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the past few years to play around with coronaviruses inside the lab through the now infamous ‘gain of function’ research. Daszak, who also works for the World Health Organisation, is on record admitting that he was involved with manipulating coronaviruses. Here is a video of him talking in DECEMBER 2019 about how ‘good’ the viruses are for altering in a lab: Daszak notes that “coronaviruses are pretty good… you can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily… the spiked proteins drive a lot about what happens. You can get the sequence you can build the protein, we work with Ralph Baric at UNC to do this, insert into the backbone of another virus and do some work in a lab.” No wonder then that Daszak as lead investigator for the WHO investigation determined within 3 hours of visiting the Wuhan lab in February 2021 that there was ‘nothing to see here’? Recently released emails now document that Daszak thanked Dr Fauci for dismissing the lab leak theory before any scientific research had been done on the possibility. Daszak was later employed as an ‘expert fact checker’ by Facebook when it was monitoring and removing ‘misinformation’ about the origins of COVID on its platform, much of which was credible scientific research. Facebook has since reversed the policy of banning any posts containing information suggesting COVID-19 was “man-made”. Daszak’s Twitter profile is basically one long ‘it came from bats not a lab’ thread, much to the annoyance of some other scientists: Having approved the awarding of NIH funding to Wuhan Institute of Virology–twice–Fauci has a massive conflict of interest on subject.Failure to disclose this conflict of interest represents journalistic malpractice.— Richard H. Ebright (@R_H_Ebright) May 5, 2020 Why does this guy keep getting put in charge of investigations, task forces and ‘fact checking’, when it’s abundantly clear that he has the biggest motive to dismiss the lab leak notion? As microbiologist Professor Richard Ebright has noted, “Daszak was the contractor who funded the laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology that potentially was the source of the virus with subcontracts from $200million [£142million] from the US Department of State and $7million [£5million] from the US National Institutes of Health and he was a collaborator and co-author on research projects at the laboratory.” Daszak has already lied about the type of research that was being conducted at the Wuhan lab, claiming, after the outbreak happened, that he didn’t know if it was gain of function or not. His own previous statements, and the Fauci emails prove he knew full well what was going on in the lab. In addition, as reported by The Daily Mail and other outlets, Daszak “orchestrated a ‘bullying’ campaign and coerced top scientists into signing off on a letter to The Lancet aimed at removing blame for Covid-19 from the Wuhan lab he was funding with US money.” Daszak used his influence to get the journal to publish the letter, which stated that to even suggest the lab leak theory had any credibility was equal to spreading “fear, rumours, and prejudice.” It effetely shut down discussion among the scientific ‘consensus’ of the lab leak potential for a whole year until intelligence findings brought the matter back to the attention of the mainstream media. WHO scientific advisor Jamie Metzl described Daszak’s letter as “scientific propaganda and a form of thuggery and intimidation.” “By labelling anyone with different views a conspiracy theorist, the Lancet letter was the worst form of bullying in full contravention of the scientific method,” Metzl added. The letter further stated that “We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin,” and even had the audacity to state that “We declare no competing interests.” Indeed, Daszak had made sure that the letter would be devoid of any link to EcoHealth, and even considered leaving his own name off it, emails released via the Freedom of Information Act have revealed. To make matters worse, the other members of The Lancet’s task force are practically all minions of Daszak, some of whom helped him draft the letter that unequivocally stated the lab leak theory was dangerous, and others who either worked with him on ‘fact checking’ for Facebook, or were cited as sources during that activity. Taking all this into account, it is obvious what the outcome of The Lancet’s inquiry will be, and it should not and cannot be used as credible evidence against the lab leak theory.

"El Salvador Approves Bitcoin as Legal Tender El Salvador became the first country in the world to officially adopt Bitcoin as legal tender on Wednesday, according to a tweet from the president’s communication secretary. Congress passed the “Bitcoin Law” with 62 votes, the tweet confirmed, finalizing the process making the cryptocurrency a legal means to pay in the small Central American country. Con 62 votos se aprueba la #LeyBitcoin, que convierte a nuestro país en el primero del mundo en tener al #Bitcoin como moneda de curso legal. pic.twitter.com/qvBdPBxWcK— Secretaría de Comunicaciones (@ComunicacionSV) June 9, 2021 In another tweet, President Nayib Bukele celebrated the passing of the law as a moment of “History!” La #LeyBitcoin acaba de ser aprobada por mayoría calificada en la @AsambleaSV.¡62 de 84 votos!¡Historia! #BTC🇸🇻— Nayib Bukele 🇸🇻 (@nayibbukele) June 9, 2021 Bukele was able to get the law passed with the help of his allies in Congress. Opposition parties, which had criticized the speed of the vote, did not back the legislation, AFP reported. What is the outlook for El Salvador’s new currency? President Bukele announced that his country would adopt the cryptocurrency during a Bitcoin conference on Saturday. He sees the move as a way of encouraging foreign investment in El Salvador, saying at the time that if just 1% of the world’s Bitcoin were to be invested in the country, “that would increase our GDP by 25%.” El Salvador is a low-income country that relies on remittances from nationals abroad. It is hoped that the adoption of the blockchain currency will ease and reduce the costs of those transfers. The country uses United States dollars as its official currency. The rollout would be handled by the mobile payments app Strike, which recently debuted in El Salvador. Bukele said that the majority in the country do not have traditional bank accounts, and that the new law will enable people to create online digital wallets with just a smartphone. However, Bitcoin’s value remains volatile, making it unsuitable as legal tender people might rely on to pay for necessities like food and rent. The value of Bitcoin has fallen by more than $25,000 (€20,500) since hitting highs of nearly $65,000 earlier this year.

"Spy phones 'in gangsters' back pockets' betray hundreds to police A global sting in which organised crime gangs were sold encrypted phones that law enforcement officials could monitor has led to more than 800 arrests and the confiscation of drugs, weapons, cash and luxury cars, officials said on Tuesday.The operation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Australian and European police ensnared suspects in Australia, Asia, Europe, South America and the Middle East involved in the narcotics trade, the officials said.Millions of dollars in cash were seized in raids around the world, along with 30 tonnes of drugs including more than eight tonnes of cocaine.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the operation had ""struck a heavy blow against organised crime – not just in this country, but ... around the world"".Operation Greenlight/Trojan Shield, conceived by Australian police and the FBI in 2018, was one of the biggest infiltrations and takeovers of a specialised encrypted network.It began when U.S. officials paid a convicted drug trafficker to give them access to a smartphone that he had customised, on which he was installing ANOM, also styled An0m, a secure encrypted messaging app. The phones were then sold to organised crime networks through underworld distributors.The FBI helped to infiltrate 12,000 devices into 300 criminal groups in more than 100 countries, Calvin Shivers of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division told reporters in The Hague.On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced the indictment of 17 suspected distributors for their involvement in marketing and selling thousands of the ANOM devices to transnational criminal organizations.All defendants are foreign nationals outside the United States and eight of them were arrested on Tuesday, said Randy Grossman, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California at a press conference in San Diego. The others remain at large.The indictment accuses the defendants of knowing that the devices they distributed were being used by criminals to coordinate drug trafficking and money laundering, Grossman said.""Today marks a culmination of more than five years of strategic, innovative, complex investigative work to disrupt and dismantle encrypted communication services that cater to the criminal element across the globe,"" said Suzanne Turner, special agent in charge of the San Diego FBI field office.COCAINE IN FRUITIn a pattern repeated elsewhere, one Australian underworld figure began distributing phones containing the app to his associates, believing their communications were secure because the phones had been rebuilt to remove all capabilities, including voice and camera functions, apart from ANOM.As a result, there was no attempt to conceal or code the details of the messages - which police were reading.""It was there to be seen, including 'we’ll have a speedboat meet you at this point', 'this is who will do this' and so on,"" Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said.""We have been in the back pockets of organised crime ... All they talk about is drugs, violence, hits on each other, innocent people who are going to be murdered.""The phones were such a hit that Italian mafiosi, Asian triads, biker gangs and transnational drug syndicates all began using them, providing the FBI and its partner forces around the world with a trove of 27 million messages.Shivers said the FBI had been able to see photographs of ""hundreds of tons of cocaine that were concealed in shipments of fruit"".PRINTERS FOR GUN PARTSAustralian police said they had arrested 224 people, including members of outlawed motorcycle gangs, and disrupted 21 murder plots.On Monday alone, they seized 104 firearms, including a military-grade sniper rifle, as well as almost A$45 million ($35 million) in cash, including A$7 million from a safe buried under a garden shed in a suburb of Sydney.In Europe, there were 49 arrests in the Netherlands, 75 in Sweden and over 60 in Germany, where authorities seized hundreds of kilograms of drugs, more than 20 weapons and over 30 luxury cars and cash.Finnish police not only detained almost 100 suspects and seized 500 kg of narcotics but also found a warehouse with 3-D printers used to manufacture gun parts.The operation also revealed that gangs were being tipped off about police actions, which prompted ""numerous high-level public corruption cases in several countries"", according to an affidavit from an FBI agent.  read more Kershaw said the Australian underworld figure, who had absconded, had ""essentially set up his own colleagues"" by distributing the phones, and was now a marked man.""The sooner he hands himself in, the better for him and his family.""

"Bitter week for families as evidence to be read in MH17 airliner trial Judges in the Netherlands will begin reading out the evidence this week in the murder trial against four fugitive suspects accused of shooting down a Malaysian airliner over rebel-held eastern Ukraine in 2014 and killing 298 people in 2014.Victims' relatives said they were expecting the testimony to bring up painful memories, but that they were grateful for a chance to hear at last what had happened aboard Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.The flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed in a field in territory held by pro-Russian separatists fighting against Ukrainian forces, after being shot down with what international investigators say was a Russian surface-to-air missile.Three Russians and a Ukrainian citizen, all suspected of having key roles in the separatist forces, are on trial for murder.

REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw/PoolRead MoreAfter a year of mostly procedural hearings, judges announced the start of the evidence phase on Monday. From Tuesday the judges will begin summarising the evidence gathered by investigators in the case, and potentially calling witnesses.Judge Hendrik Steenhuis said his panel would be looking specifically to determine what type of missile hit the airplane, where it was fired from and whether the four suspects can be held responsible.""It is taking a long time but we want to know the truth. It is the only thing we can still do for the children,"" said Rob Frederiksz, whose 23-year-old son Bryce died along with his girlfriend Daisy in the crash.After years of collecting evidence, a team of international investigators concluded in May 2018 that the missile launcher used to shoot down the aircraft belonged to Russia's 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade. The Dutch government holds Moscow responsible. Russia denies any involvement.On Monday the Kremlin said it was following the trial and took note of ""alternative information"" that could lead to other explanations of the crash from the Dutch prosecutor's main theory of the Russian-made missile fired by pro-Russian separatists.""But again, because we are not part of the investigation, we cannot directly influence what is happening,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1

"Women score historic wins in Mexico’s mid-term elections Women were poised to win a record number of state governors’ offices in Mexican mid-term elections on Sunday, capturing territory long dominated by men and giving them a bigger political platform to reach the presidency one day.Preliminary tallies by electoral authorities on Monday showed female candidates securing six of the 15 regional bastions on offer, just two shy of the total number of women ever elected to lead regional governments in Mexico's history.Five of the six went to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), which dominated the state votes, even as the leftist party’s hold on the lower house of Congress weakened. If results are confirmed, it means the northern border states of Baja California and Chihuahua, Guerrero and Colima on the Pacific coast, as well as Tlaxcala in the center and Campeche in the south, will be governed by women.""This is a cultural shift,"" said MORENA lawmaker Gabriela Cuevas, the first Mexican to head the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a global body of national parliaments. ""And definitely a step forward for women in our country and in political life.""Only eight women had previously won regional elections, including the current mayor of Mexico City, MORENA's Claudia Sheinbaum, who is regarded as one of the favorites to succeed Lopez Obrador as president.Since Griselda Alvarez was chosen to run Colima in 1979 - a few weeks after Margaret Thatcher made history as Britain's first woman Prime Minister - Mexico's handful of female governors very rarely overlapped with other women in the job.Now seven out of the 32 regional governments, including Mexico City, will be run by women simultaneously.That is likely to create space for a different kind of politics where women's concerns gain in prominence, said Francisco Abundis, head of Mexican polling firm Parametria.That was especially true as three of the new governors are under 40 and may have long careers ahead of them, he noted.VOTER STRENGTHThe latest national census showed there are roughly 3 million more women than men among Mexico's population of 126 million, and political leaders are increasingly at pains to ensure equal representation in government.Lopez Obrador made history in 2018 by appointing a cabinet split evenly between men and women, though he has come under fire from women's groups for failing to take seriously enough issues like domestic violence and abortion rights.Many women were angry about Lopez Obrador's support for MORENA's original candidate for Guerrero, Felix Salgado, whose campaign was dogged by rape accusations.Salgado denied the allegations but was eventually forced out of the race by electoral authorities for campaign finance irregularities. He was replaced by his daughter Evelyn, who won Guerrero on Sunday night, the results showed.Some Mexicans argue that male domination is still too deeply entrenched in the country for a female president to be realistic as soon as 2024, when the next election is due.""Because of the macho mentality,"" argued Gypsy Lara, a 29-year-old business owner in Mexico City who said she would be happy to back Sheinbaum for president.Sheinbaum, whose popularity took a hit last month over a metro accident that killed 26 people, had a tough night on Sunday with MORENA suffering shock losses in city elections.Despite the setbacks, the 58-year-old is still one of the strongest candidates for the presidency, said Abundis.""I think (female candidates) will be one of the cards to play in 2024,"" he said. ""With everything we're seeing in terms of gender-based movements in the country and the world, in Mexico it's more of a contrast with the whole macho tradition.""Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Officials Resign After Censoring Vet’s Memorial Day Speech Two officials have resigned after they fueled outrage for censoring a veteran’s speech during a Memorial Day event. The officials, two women who who helped organized the event in Hudson, Ohio, initially claimed they had every right to censor the veteran’s speech by turning off his microphone, stating that segments of his speech didn’t fit the”program’s theme of honoring the city’s veterans.” “They knew exactly when to turn the volume down and when to turn it back up,” said Roger Friend, department commander for the Ohio American Legion. The segments of the speech the officials had an issue with revolved around how freed Black slaves had honored fallen soldiers soon after the Civil War. Presumably, the officials believed that 19th-century fallen soldiers had nothing to do with “the city’s veterans,” a plausible explanation that, if true, nevertheless highlights the nitpickiness of Karen culture. In short, the desire to be that controlling overshadows someone’s freedom of speech – and that desire is so powerful that the poor optics of censoring a veteran on Memorial Day is apparently never considered beforehand. The veteran’s speech had to be submitted for approval prior to the event, as if a Gulf War veteran is that controversial. In general, the Karen culture is one of self-centeredness in which nobody’s feelings are considered, which in turn leads to a decline in society as people feel more isolated and less connected to community.",0,0
"Portugal minister says Spain requiring COVID-19 test at border 'a mistake' Portugal's foreign minister said Spain's decision to require a negative COVID-19 test for people crossing the border must have been an error, Lusa news agency reported on Monday.Portugal had asked Spanish authorities for clarification on ""what could only have been a mistake"", Portugal's foreign minister Augusto Santos Silva said.""We have asked Spanish authorities for clarification and await it being granted as quickly as possible, because if not we will need to adopt equivalent reciprocal measures,"" Santos Silva said, adding that ""the epidemiological situation in Spain is, at the moment, worse than what we are living in Portugal.""The land border between the two Iberian nations reopened on May 1 after three months of restrictions and checks, providing relief to local tourist hotspots.Currently, Spain requires air travellers to be tested or vaccinated, while Portugal requires a negative test from travellers from Spain. But neither country had required tests for people crossing the border by land.A Spanish health ministry spokesperson said people crossing the border would be obliged to carry health documentation in the same way that a driver is expected to have their vehicle's papers in case of sporadic checks.The protocol is exactly the same as that applied at Spain's other border with northern neighbour France, the spokesperson said, adding that cross-border workers and transport sector employees would be exempt.The website for the General Consulate of Spain in Portugal said on Monday that all those aged 6 and above crossing the land border from Portugal to Spain must have a negative COVID-19 test, proof of vaccination, or proof of an antibody test.Spain's Health Ministry website said that all travellers from 'high risk' zones needed to show a negative PCR test upon entry from June 7. A list of high-risk countries included Portugal, alongside 26 other European countries and nearly all countries outside the bloc.Spain's two-week COVID-19 case incidence rate was 115 according to the latest available data on Monday, while Portugal's was 72.2.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Peaceful Capitol Protester Threatened With 20 Yrs In Prison For Taking Selfie And Praying On Senate Floor Takes Plea Deal Peaceful Jan 6 Capitol protester Paul Allard Hodgkins was maliciously overcharged by the feds with “obstructing an official proceeding of Congress” and faced 20 years in prison for the crime of taking a selfie on the Senate floor with others as they “cheered and said prayers.” Hodgkins only spent 15 minutes inside “the People’s House” but after being threatened with two decades in prison he accepted a plea deal on Wednesday leaving him facing some “15 to 21 months [in prison] under federal guidelines.” From The Washington Post, “Tampa man pleads guilty to felony in Jan. 6 Capitol riot; his recommended prison sentence could set bar for other cases”: Alex Jones breaks down the well documented public racism and motives to enact racist legislation of President Joe Biden. A Tampa man who carried a Trump flag into the well of the Senate on Jan. 6 pleaded guilty Wednesday to one felony count of storming the Capitol to obstruct Congress’s certification of the 2020 presidential election.Paul Allard Hodgkins, 38, did not enter a cooperation deal with prosecutors, and he is not accused of any other wrongdoing or involvement with extremist groups.In admitting to the stiffest felony count charged by prosecutors against individuals not otherwise accused of conspiracy or violence in the Capitol riot, Hodgkins faces a prison sentence of 15 to 21 months under federal guidelines. His sentencing is poised to become a test case watched by other defendants deciding whether to accept pleas, several defense lawyers said.“I have decided that I will accept this plea offer, and I will plead guilty to charge one,” Hodgkins told U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss.Hodgkins’s attorney, Patrick Leduc, said he would seek a lower sentence at a sentencing hearing as soon as July 19, and he asked the judge to waive a $7,500 to $75,000 fine because his client also agreed to pay $2,000 in restitution for his share of riot damage to the Capitol.[…] “Paul is an Eagle Scout with no prior record, a working Joe who is a crane operator at a steel processing plant,” who spent 15 minutes inside the Capitol, Leduc said.[…] Nearly half the defendants face only misdemeanor charges likely to carry no prison time for first offenders. However, about 200 are charged with obstructing an official proceeding of Congress and are accused of intending to impede or interfere with Congress’s confirmation of the electoral vote count. The charge carries a maximum 20-year prison term.The threat of heavy jail time led to the first guilty plea stemming from Jan. 6 by Jon Ryan Schaffer, described in court documents as a founding member of the Oath Keepers. Schaffer agreed on April 16 to cooperate fully with prosecutors and is among at least 19 members of the right-wing group whose members or associates have been charged with planning for violence in the Capitol attack. Schaffer, 53, a guitarist and songwriter for the heavy metal band Iced Earth, could face roughly four years in prison, although if his cooperation is valuable to prosecutors in other cases, he might be able to shave a significant amount of time off that sentence.[…] Hodgkins admitted that he “corruptly endeavored to influence, obstruct, or impede” Congress in a signed statement of offense that was read by prosecutors in court. Reading from the statement, Sedky said Hodgkins was holding the flag with other individuals while they “shout, cheer and say prayers” from the elevated platform and desk in the Senate well. Overcharging drug dealers in the hood to extract plea deals is “systemic oppression” but overcharging folks like Hodgkins for taking a selfie and praying is “defending democracy!”",0,1

"Harris has ‘robust’ Guatemala graft talks, tells migrants: ‘do not come’ U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said on Monday she had “robust” talks with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei on the need to fight corruption to help deter undocumented immigration from Central America to the United States.At a news conference with Giammattei, Harris said a U.S. task force would work with local prosecutors to punish corrupt actors in the region.The Biden administration has identified corruption as an underlying cause of the poverty and violence driving record numbers of Central Americans to go to the United StatesIn the build up to Harris' visit to Guatemala, her first official overseas trip, differences of opinion emerged about the fight against graft, with corruption fighters feted by Washington being criticized by Giammattei.""We had a robust, candid and thorough conversation,"" Harris said at the news conference after a three-hour meeting with Giammattei, who said they had discussed U.S. concerns about developments in Guatemala.""The president and I discussed the importance of anti-corruption and the importance of an independent judiciary,"" Harris said. Washington has criticized the removal of a senior judge from Guatemala's top court, in what Giammattei has argued was a legitimate process.The corruption task force has been previously floated, but Harris gave more details, saying it will combine resources from the Justice, State and Treasury departments.Giammattei defended his own record in fighting corruption, saying he had not been accused of wrongdoing and saying graft was not only a problem faced by politicians. The fight against drug trafficking needed to be an integral part of tackling corruption, he said.On the immigration front he announced a new processing center for migrants sent back from Mexico and the United States, which could increase capacity. He said the focus of the two countries should be on creating prosperity.Most Guatemalan migrants leave because of poverty, he said, and come from a few rural municipalities.

"Ahead of Putin meeting, Biden tells Zelenskiy he will stand up for Ukraine’s sovereignty U.S. President Joe Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday that he will stand up for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity ahead of a summit between Biden and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.National security advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters the two leaders spoke about the bilateral relationship in a phone call prior to Biden's trip to Europe.""They had the opportunity to talk at some length about all of the issues in US-Ukraine relationship and President Biden was able to tell President Zelensky that he will stand up firmly for Ukraine sovereignty, territorial integrity, and its aspirations as we go forward,"" Sullivan said.Putin and Biden will meet in Geneva on June 16 amid sharp disagreements over election interference, human rights and Ukraine. In his first call in April with Zelenskiy after taking office, Biden offered Ukraine his “unwavering support” as Russia built up troops on Ukraine’s eastern border in a standoff that worried Kyiv and its Western backers. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy's chief of staff, said the Ukrainian leader and Biden coordinated their policy positions.Zelenskiy said on Twitter the phone call also covered Ukraine's aspirations to join the NATO military alliance and Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Washington has been Ukraine’s most powerful ally since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, though Kyiv was taken aback by the Biden administration’s decision to waive sanctions on the company behind Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Zelenskiy told the U.S. news website Axios in an interview last week he was ""surprised"" and ""disappointed"" by the decision.Ukraine had also hoped its Western allies would make a renewed effort to admit Ukraine into the NATO military alliance in the wake of the border standoff with Russia and was disappointed not to be invited to a NATO summit this month.

"Chris Wallace Defends Fauci: Wuhan Lab Leak Emails Contain ‘No Smoking Gun’ Fox News anchor Chris Wallace defended Dr. Anthony Fauci on Friday following the release of thousands of his emails. The emails, released through the Freedom of Information Act, reveal Fauci had publicly lied about gain of function research funding and mask effectiveness, and actively downplayed the Wuhan lab leak theory despite growing evidence. “I’ve read reports and read through a number of the emails. There’s no smoking gun there that indicates that Fauci had any reason to believe this had come from the laboratory, from the Wuhan virology laboratory,” Wallace said on “America’s Newsroom.” “I’ll answer the question, even though Jen Psaki wouldn’t — this is highly political. I can promise you. You’re seeing it as a major talking point from Republicans. I think that when Donald Trump speaks tomorrow night in North Carolina, you’re going to see him go after Fauci.” Wallace then insisted Fauci had been “on the firing lines” since the 1980s over his public health recommendations during the AIDS pandemic. “Let’s just remember. Anthony Fauci has been on the firing lines trying to protect Americans from public health issues since the mid-80s with AIDS. And before we start calling for his head, this guy who’s been a devoted public servant for 40 years, maybe we ought to slow down just a little bit.” Reporter John Roberts chimed in, “Yeah, he is a survivor. There is no question about that.” Wallace shot back, “He is more than survivor. He’s a public servant John.” Is it standard practice for a public health expert to repeatedly lie to the public over research funding of a virus that caused a global pandemic, or about the efficacy of mask-wearing to protect from the coronavirus?

"Canada takes cautious step toward lifting border restrictions, businesses fret Canada on Wednesday took a cautious first step toward easing COVID-19 border restrictions, saying it was prepared to relax quarantine protocols for fully vaccinated citizens returning home starting in early July.Canada's air and land borders have allowed for only essential travel since March of last year, and people returning home are required to quarantine for 14 days. If they arrive by air, they also must stay in a designated hotel until they receive a negative COVID-19 test.""The first step ... is to allow fully vaccinated individuals currently permitted to enter Canada to do so without the requirement to stay in government-authorized accommodation,"" Health Minister Patty Hajdu told reporters on Wednesday.The easing of restrictions will hinge on COVID-19 case numbers and vaccinations, she said.Canadian businesses, especially airlines and those that depend on tourism, have been lobbying the Liberal government to relax restrictions. Hajdu made clear Ottawa would act slowly.Asked about calls from businesses to lift restrictions starting on June 22, Hajdu said: ""We do want to be cautious and careful on these next steps to be sure that we are not putting that recovery in jeopardy.""The Canadian Airports Council said it was ""disappointed the new measures were not extended to all vaccinated travellers and that there is still no plan for a restart of travel"" while the Chamber of Commerce said much work remained.The opposition Conservatives, almost neck and neck in polls with the Liberals ahead of an election expected this year, demanded an end to the quarantine program and said ""Canadians can't afford more pandemic mismanagement from (Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau.""By June 21, Canada is due to decide whether to extend land border restrictions with the United States. The measures do not affect trade.Hajdu said Canada would take a ""phased approach towards adjusting current border measures.""It is still unclear when the border rules might change for foreign travelers.There will be as many as seven phases, with borders not fully open until some 75% of Canadians are fully vaccinated, a source familiar with the matter said.Canada is working on a certificate that can be presented at the border as proof of vaccination, Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc told reporters.Even if fully vaccinated, Canadians will be required to take a COVID-19 test before departure and upon arrival, and then quarantine until they receive a negative result, Hajdu saidSome 70% of eligible Canadians have received a first shot, Procurement Minister Anita Anand said, while about 10% are fully vaccinated.Canada is due to get millions of doses of both the Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) and Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccines in June.

"ASEAN ministers pressure Myanmar after 'painfully slow' progress Southeast Asian foreign ministers mediating on the crisis in Myanmar called on Monday for its military rulers to free prisoners and start an agreed political dialogue, expressing disappointment at ""very slow"" progress so far.The United Nations, Western countries and China back the effort by the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to find a way out of the crisis in Myanmar, a country paralysed by turmoil since a Feb. 1 coup that ended a decade of tentative democracy.Vivian Balakrishnan, foreign minister of Singapore, a key investor in Myanmar, said the ASEAN diplomatic effort ""only makes sense if there is a genuine desire within Myanmar itself for genuine dialogue and negotiations and reconciliation.""To be honest with you, we are disappointed at the slow – very, very slow progress,"" he told Singapore media in a call from Chongqing, China, where ASEAN foreign ministers met their Chinese counterpart on Monday.Myanmar's junta has shown little sign of heeding a consensus reached in April among the 10 ASEAN countries, including Myanmar, which calls for an end to violence, political talks and the naming of a regional special envoy.""Indonesia is really hoping that the implementation of the five points of consensus needs to be pushed after this meeting with, once again, a transparent process,"" Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi told a news conference.Malaysian Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said ASEAN must admit that progress on the consensus was ""painfully slow"".""The int'l (international) community is awaiting ASEAN's further action,"" he said on Twitter.In a summary of remarks read at the meeting, he said ASEAN ""must act more quickly to reduce tensions and stop violence"".The junta has struggled to impose control since ousting elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, which triggered a wave of anger, protests and strikes, and efforts to build a nationwide alliance to thwart the military's bid to consolidate power.TRIAL LOOMSNobel laureate Suu Kyi, 75, will go on trial next week in the first of several criminal cases against her, according to her lawyer, who met her on Monday for a court hearing.The charges include illegal possession of two-way radios, breaking coronavirus protocols, and bribery.The trial must be concluded by July 26, chief lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told Reuters, citing the presiding judge.

His public speeches and meetings with foreign dignitaries, businessmen, government officials and Buddhist monks have been a daily staple on state-controlled television.In a statement dated June 5, ASEAN said the objective of the visit was to discuss how Myanmar would reach ""a peaceful solution in the interests of its people"" by implementing the five points.It said they had also ""called for the release of all political prisoners, including women and children and foreigners"" - an appeal that was not in the consensus but is supported by many ASEAN members.Reuters could not reach a junta spokesman for comment on Monday.The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar said the meeting covered ""implementation of the recommendation of initial survey of ASEAN"", the army's plan to hold elections, and ""terror acts"" by its opponents.Opponents of the junta and many people in Myanmar have shown frustration at the lack of tough action by ASEAN and its failure to include other political stakeholders, particularly the ousted government.Min Aung Hlaing met China'a ambassador to Myanmar on Saturday. China's state-run Global Times newspaper quoted the junta leader as saying Myanmar was willing to coordinate implementation of the consensus.It reported that the ambassador had said China was ready to support that.After Monday's meeting, Indonesia's Retno said Chinese help would be ""highly appreciated as this will contribute to achieving a peaceful solution"".Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Peru on knife-edge as battle builds over election count with socialists ahead Peruvian socialist Pedro Castillo held a wafer-thin lead in a polarized presidential election on Wednesday, as rival Keiko Fujimori doubled down on unproven allegations of voter fraud, which could spark weeks of political wrangling.Castillo, the son of illiterate farmers who has rattled the Andean nation's political elite and garnered huge support from the rural poor, had 50.2% with virtually all votes processed, just a 0.4 percentage point ahead of right-wing Keiko Fujimori, or 74,000 votes.Fujimori, the heir of a powerful political family, however, on Wednesday night alleged that about 500,000 votes were suspicious, although she provided little in way of proof. She questioned the likeliness of voting tables grouping up to 300 voters in which she got not votes at all.""We think it is crucial that these (allegations) be analyzed in the final count,"" Fujimori said, who added that she was not saying that electoral authorities were complicit in any wrongdoing.The leftist's party has strongly denied the claims and electoral observers say the vote was carried out cleanly.The allegations, with some echoes of the legal wrangling after the U.S. election last year, may trigger weeks of confusion and tension, amid a polarized election cycle that has divided Peruvians, with higher-income citizens supporting the right-wing candidate and lower-income ones supporting Castillo.""The people are tired, if they continue to trample over our rights that our president has already won, we are going to get into a social struggle,"" said Justiniano Ilario, a teacher supporting Castillo while on a protest march.""Enough is enough, the people from the provinces, we are tired of this outrage of corruption that exists everywhere.""Luis Cano, wearing a ""Keiko"" cap in a rival street protest, said the Castillo supporters were using tactics other authoritarian leftists in the region had done before to win the vote.Hundreds of voters on both sides have taken to the streets to protest for their candidate, mostly peacefully and even at times with musicians and dancers. Castillo has made calls on supporters to “defend the vote”. There are also some 300,000 contested votes, which will need to be further scrutinized by an electoral jury, a process that will take several days to complete and could tip the balance.The world's no. 2 copper producer saw three presidents in a week last year amid political scandals and protests, has been hit by the world's deadliest COVID-19 outbreak and posted its worst economic plunge in three decades last year.'TIGHTEST ELECTIONS'Fujimori had closed the gap slightly overnight as almost all the overseas votes that favor the conservative candidate came in, though not by enough to rein in Castillo's lead as she had hoped, leaving disputed votes as her last potential reprieve.""It's unlikely that at this point that Fujimori will overtake Castillo,"" said David Sulmont, a sociology professor at Peru's Pontifical Catholic University and former head of their polling unit.""It is one of the country's tightest elections,"" he added. ""The margin may keep varying, but I think Castillo will be the winner.""On Wednesday, a key economic adviser to Castillo told Reuters that the leftist would maintain a “market economy” if named president and there would not be massive state interventions in the economy. The aide added though that mining taxes would be raised to pay for planned educational and healthcare reforms, though recognized the sector must retain competitive.Peru's sol currency , gained around 2% on Wednesday, though stocks were down more than 3% with mining sector shares among the worst hit. 'COMPANION IN STRUGGLE'A win for Castillo, a teacher who was the surprise victor in the first-round vote in April, would mark a major advance for Latin America's left amid rising discontent over poverty and inequality that has been sharpened by the COVID-19 pandemic.On Tuesday evening, Castillo came close to claiming victory. ""We already have the official party tally, where the people have won this fight,"" he told supporters, referring to an unofficial vote count conducted by his party, Free Peru.Bolivia's former President Evo Morales, an iconic leftist whose socialist party is now in power in that country, also congratulated Castillo on his ""victory"" in a post on Twitter, calling him a ""brother of the soul and companion in struggle"".Fujimori is on her third attempt to become president, having been the runner-up in the last two cycles. In 2016, she lost by a margin of 0.24 of a percentage point.Castillo has spooked markets with proposals to redistribute mining wealth, redraft the constitution and raise taxes on mining firms, a key source of revenue for the Andean country, though he has looked to moderate his tone in recent days.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1

"EU looked at ‘importing 70 million Africans’ by 2035, says German MEP Gunnar Beck, denouncing ‘disastrous’ new migration pact A leading figure in Alternative for Germany, tipped for victory in a German election this week, Gunnar Beck is attacking the EU’s ‘deeply dangerous’ migration pact before it’s enacted under cover of a feelgood summer. As Germany’s ‘super election year’ focuses on the state of Saxony-Anhalt this Sunday, the disruptors in the nation’s biggest opposition party, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), are poised for a shock win as its anti-immigration message resonates in the heartlands of former East Germany. Sitting top of the most recent INSA opinion poll with 26% and having just announced its two lead candidates for September’s federal elections – both supporters of a hard line on immigration – AfD is not about to soften its message. Germany (Saxony-Anhalt regional election), INSA poll: AfD-ID: 26% (+2)CDU-EPP: 25% (-1)LINKE-LEFT: 13%GRÜNE-G/EFA: 11% (-1)SPD-S&D: 10%FDP-RE: 8% (+2) +/- vs. 20-27 Apr Fieldwork: 17-23 May 2021Sample size: 1,000➤ https://t.co/obOCVirbpF#ltwlsa #Ltw #ltwsa pic.twitter.com/swS8fdXXmf — Europe Elects (@EuropeElects) May 26, 2021 Senior AfD figure and Euro MP Gunnar Beck said a strong election result would prove a useful weapon in his party’s battle against the European Union’s controversial proposed Pact on Migration and Asylum that looks to enlist its members in a centrally-run redistribution of asylum seekers across the bloc. “I have myself been working on the EU migration pact for some time and for me the enactment of such a pact would be disastrous,” Beck told RT.com. “Because the EU not too long ago was talking about importing up to 70 million Africans into Europe by 2035. In my humble opinion this is not what we need to modernise our economy. “And while the figure seems high, when the members of our migration pact campaign – including delegates from Denmark, Estonia, France and Belgium – met with the Commission just last year, that migration figure was brought up but no one at the Commission chose to deny it. “ That suggestion of actively encouraging inward migration to the EU has been floating around Brussels for a while, as governments across the bloc look at ways to address the phenomenon known as the ‘greying of Europe’ where ageing populations aged 65 or older and low birthrates pose ‘considerable social, economic and political challenges in countries such as Germany and Italy’ according to the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank. Some politicians, such as former European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker believe an influx of younger workers from Africa is the solution. Meanwhile, the migration pact currently appears stuck in parliamentary committees, the received wisdom is that it’s being deliberately stalled until the outcome of the German federal elections is known in September. Beck suggests an alternative reason for the unusual delay. “It’s not gone through all the committees in the European Parliament and the negotiations of the Council [of Europe] haven’t started but I think the EU would like to push the legislation through from July onwards,” he said. “Now that all the countries are phasing out the lockdown and people are generally feeling better about themselves and able to leave their homes again. So the possibility is that they’ll try to use the general feelgood atmosphere – summer combined with corona relaxations – to push ahead with this deeply dangerous legislative package,” Beck said. And maybe Beck’s right. Because the European Parliament’s final plenary session is early July and then it doesn’t sit again until mid-September. If the pact proposals are put to MEPs in July and inevitably passed, there is plenty of time for it to lose its sting over the extended summer break. It will be just like it was there all the time. That should play well for AfD in the federal elections, which are slated for September 22, but Beck is not so sure. “It’s possible that migration will become an important issue in the federal election,” he said. “And the EU migration pact to those of us in the EU delegation is an important campaign but whether that can be turned into an election campaign is a different story.” Nevertheless, a win on Sunday for AfD would indicate that despite a huge surge in Green Party popularity nationwide, Germans are interested in more than climate change, particularly in states such as Saxony-Anhalt, home to one of Germany’s three main coal mines. A recent poll there found that climate change was considered important by just 6% of respondents, whereas a national survey found 75% of folk were concerned for the planet. Observers liken the voters of Saxony-Anhalt – which has a population of 2.2million – to those ‘left-behinds’ who Donald Trump wooed, and the so-called ‘Red Wall’ voters in the UK who felt their traditional party no longer represented them. Beck agrees. “The election this week will probably be the first time that we become the strongest single party and that will be a huge success,” he said. “There’s widespread dissatisfaction in east Germany about the state of politics in this country and that dissatisfaction can translate very frictionlessly into increasing support for the AfD because our party is not stigmatised there. In west Germany it’s distinctly more difficult there. The campaign to stigmatise us has been more successful and some of the other parties profit from that dissatisfaction. But not us.” Those efforts to discredit a party, which would most likely sit alongside the Conservative right in the UK, take a huge electoral toll. Despite coalitions being commonplace in Germany, no one dares buddy-up with AfD. So, despite topping last week’s poll in Saxony-Anhalt, even if AfD wins the greatest vote share on Sunday, it will be relegated to the opposition benches, thanks to a cosy three-party so-called ‘Kenya’ coalition agreement between the Greens, Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, nicknamed as such because their respective party colours of green, red and black echo the African nation’s flag. But an AfD victory will have some impact. It would prove no small embarrassment to the ruling establishment, particularly the CDU, who will be facing September’s elections without Angela Merkel and face their own internal battles as some members urge a tilt towards the right under the leadership of charisma-free Armin Laschet. At least for the time being, however, AfD will take the win and, while it will irk the party to be denied the seat of power, at least its supporters can be sure that they are making a difference.",0,1
"Medical Journal Describes “Whiteness” as a Parasitic Pathology That Has No Cure A research study published in the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association describes “whiteness” as a parasitic pathology that has no cure. Yes, really. The article, which is entitled ‘On Having Whiteness’, was written by Dr. Donald Moss (who is white), a faculty member of both the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and the San Francisco Center for Psychoanalysis. Moss asserts that white people have a “particular susceptibility” to the “parasitic” condition, which he says “renders its hosts’ appetites voracious, insatiable, and perverse” and leads them to “terrorize” non-whites. The nutty academic then frames “whiteness” as a malignant disease that can only be prevented via massive programs of re-education. 🚨🚨: The Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association just published a study likening ""whiteness"" to ""a malignant, parasitic-like condition"" for which ""there is not yet a permanent cure."" This is nuts. pic.twitter.com/rVqYJ0C2Fq — John Cooper (@thejcoop) June 9, 2021 “Effective treatment consists of a combination of psychic and social-historical interventions. Such interventions can reasonably aim only to reshape Whiteness’s infiltrated appetites—to reduce their intensity, redistribute their aims, and occasionally turn those aims toward the work of reparation,” he writes. Even then, Moss laments that there “is no guarantee against regression” and “[t]here is not yet a permanent cure.” This kind unhinged rhetoric is also being spewed by Moss’ teaching colleagues in schools and universities across American under the guise of Critical Race Theory. The article once again underscores how the only form of allowed “systemic racism” and discrimination that exists in the west is against white people. When literally every major cultural institution, government entity, the entertainment industry, academia and the media amplifies this kind of bile, the notion of “white privilege” is laughable. ——————————————————————————————————————— ALERT!

"Pence Emerges: Trump and I May Never “See Eye to Eye” on Events of January 6 Former Vice President Mike Pence says he and President Donald Trump still disagree on the events of Jan. 6, when the president urged Pence to reject electoral votes. Emerging from obscurity at an annual Republican dinner in New Hampshire Thursday, Pence touched on the January 6 Capitol fracas and his current relationship with Donald Trump. “Jan. 6 is a dark day in the history of the United States Capitol. But thanks to the swift action of the Capitol Police and federal law enforcement, violence was quelled,” Pence said. “You know, President Trump and I have spoken many times since we left office. And I don’t know if we’ll ever see eye to eye on that day. But I will always be proud of what we accomplished for the American people over the last four years.” Elsewhere in his speech to the Hillsborough County Lincoln-Reagan Dinner, Pence slammed the Biden-Harris administration’s agenda which he said was dismantling all the advancements made by the Trump administration. “We made history. We made a difference. We made America greater than ever before,” Pence said describing his and Trump’s reign after being introduced by New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R). “But how times have changed. You know the governor said he didn’t come here to bash the current administration. Well I did.” Declaring “enough is enough,” Pence outlined how “the Biden administration and Democrats in Washington have been pushing open borders, higher taxes, runaway spending, more government, defunding the police, abandoning the right to life, censoring free speech, [and] canceling our most cherished liberties.” “In 2020, you remember Joe Biden was campaigning as a moderate when he campaigned, but he’s literally governed as the most liberal president since FDR,” Pence stated. “So buckle up. I mean 134 days, and the Biden-Harris administration has launched an avalanche of big government liberal policies, the likes of which I’ve never even imagined I’d see in our lifetime, and all of it designed to derail the progress that we made over the last four years.” Watch Pence’s full speech below: Exclusive: Mike Pence Threatened Trump With 25th Amendment Removal If He Didn’t Concede Fraudulent Election",0,1
"Spain backtracks on nightlife rules after regional complaints Spain's health ministry on Wednesday scrapped a nationwide plan to gradually reopen nightlife just a week after introducing it, following widespread complaints from regional authorities who dismissed it as either too strict or too loose.The plan, which would have allowed areas with low infection rates to open nightclubs until 3 a.m., drew the ire of several regions and a legal challenge from Madrid's conservative leader Isabel Diaz Ayuso. read more After a week of tension, health chiefs from Spain's 17 regions unanimously approved a revised version of the document on Wednesday in which the rules are reduced to non-binding guidelines, Health Minister Carolina Darias told reporters.""The measures for the hospitality sector are no longer included in the document, and those for nightlife...are now recommendations,"" she said at a news conference.""It doesn't mean that (clubs) will open everywhere, but rather that each region, depending on its epidemiological situation, will decide how to open,"" she added.While Madrid's Ayuso, who won a landslide election campaigning for looser COVID-19 measures, slammed the plan as restricting civil liberties, Basque leader Inigo Urkullu said he wanted tougher rules to curb infections, highlighting the stark divisions between regions.Since a nationwide state of emergency expired a month ago restrictions on travel and business have eased, with bars in most regions open until midnight or later.Transmission has fallen steadily as vaccination rates have picked up, Darias said, adding that Spain's 14-day infection rate had fallen 5% over the week to 111.9 cases per 100,000 people.Provisional data showed 24% of the population had received a full course of vaccine, while nearly 43% had at least one dose.One of a handful of countries participating in an early rollout of the European Union's digital vaccine certificate, Spain has given out nearly 125,000 of the green cards since Monday, Darias said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Analysis: Peru markets and miners fear Castillo, see silver lining in split vote Peru’s market and mining watchers are wary of a presidential election victory for socialist Pedro Castillo, who was building a narrow lead on Monday, but see a potential silver lining: a sharply split vote could hinder his plans for dramatic reforms.The leftist candidate has rattled miners and investors since a surprise win in the first-round vote in April, pledging to tear up Peru's decades-old constitution and take up to 70% of profits from firms mining in the country's copper-rich Andes.On Monday the former teacher and union leader held a razor-thin, though growing, lead over his market-friendly conservative rival Keiko Fujimori in the run-off vote. The country's sol currency and equities sank.A final tally may take days to arrive and there could be challenges to the results.""The only positive factor - even if Castillo wins - is that the result of the election shows you that the country is very divided,"" said Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging market strategist at Generali Asset Management.""And with a divided congress it will be very hard for him to implement structural and disruptive reforms.""Whoever wins the presidential vote, Peru will have a deeply fragmented legislature with ten diverse political parties, none of whom hold a majority. Castillo's Free Peru socialists will have the largest bloc, followed by Fujimori's conservatives.Peru's congress has relished clashing with the presidency in the past. Last year, it pushed through a controversial impeachment process against then-President Martin Vizcarra that forced him to step down and sparked deadly protests.Mining firm executives in the country stayed mostly quiet on Monday as they waited for the final outcome.Roque Benavides, chief executive of local miner Buenaventura, told Reuters that miners could agree to things like voluntary contributions to finance local infrastructure projects but more drastic measures like nationalizations would derail investments.""I think that neither of the two candidates can impose their position and therefore I think that the idea of them making dramatic, drastic changes is very debatable,"" he said.Francisco Acuña, a Santiago-based analyst at mining consultancy CRU, said it was quite likely the new government would need to negotiate and reach consensus with companies.""It is evident that the country is torn. Whoever wins, the margin will be minimal,"" he said.RADICAL CHANGESGustavo Medeiros, deputy head of research at emerging market-focused fund manager Ashmore Group, said that a Fujimori presidency would bring less risks of ""populism"" than Castillo, though there was much still unknown about the leftist.""Whoever wins is going to have to govern with a very fragmented congress and that is going to complicate any radical structural legislative changes,"" he said, adding that market weakness from a Castillo win could create a buying opportunity.Castillo said in a statement on Monday evening that if confirmed as president he would respect the central bank's authority and that he was not planning nationalizations or expropriations, but added a tax overhaul on mining was needed to help pay for planned healthcare and education reforms.Julio Ruiz, chief economist for Mexico and Peru at Brazilian bank Itau, said a win for Fujimori - who has pledged to keep in place market-friendly policies that underpinned Peru's economic growth in recent decades - would be more positive for markets.A win for Castillo, said Ruiz, could lead to pressure on the exchange rate and raise the probability that the central bank would hike rates before the end of the year to avoid inflationary pressures.Alejo Czerwonko, Chief Investment Officer for Emerging Markets Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said a Castillo win would lead to a sell-off in Peruvian assets, though he faced challenges turning his rhetoric into reality.""Whether he manages to deliver will depend on how well he navigates the institutional constraints he will face given his party only enjoys 42 out of the 130 seats in congress,"" he said.“Key to watch is whether he is successful in his attempt to push for a constitutional reform.”Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Socialist Castillo clings on to tight lead in Peru election as count nears end Peruvian socialist candidate Pedro Castillo held on to a narrow lead late on Tuesday in the country’s runoff presidential election, as tensions rose over contested ballots and accusations of fraud, which sparked protests outside the elections office.Castillo, who has worried markets and mining firms with his plans to shake up the copper-rich country's politics, held a slim lead of some 50.3%, ahead of right-wing rival Keiko Fujimori on 49.7%, with almost 98% of the votes tallied.That amounts to a lead of 88,000 votes.A preliminary count is likely to end on Wednesday, although about 300,000 votes have been contested and will need to be reviewed by an electoral jury, which will take days to resolve.It is unclear whether those contested votes will be enough to swing the election in favor of Fujimori, especially after Castillo modestly broadened his lead during the day from as low as 70,000 votes. On Monday, Fujimori made unsubstantiated accusations of fraud, adding fuel to an already tense situation, and publicized a hashtag for Twitter users to submit instances of what she called ""irregularities.""Electoral experts, including international observers, told Reuters that no fraud had been observed, but that did not stop people from staging protests.""We are protesting because of the flagrant electoral steal. The (elections office) is playing in favor of Mr. Castillo, they are trying to commit fraud in his favor,"" said Fernando Tavera, a pro-Fujimori protester outside the elections office.Castillo backers also flocked to the elections office to voice their support in counter-protests. Both sets of demonstrations were peaceful.Lourdes Morales, who supports Castillo, said, ""We think it's a scandal the way (Fujimori) has increased her voting numbers,"" referring to how the conservative had slowly narrowed the gap on Castillo for most of the day. ""And that generates uncertainty,"" she said.Lima is where Fujimori has the most support. Castillo, the son of peasant farmers, had surged late in the count as more of the rural vote came in, leading by over 100,000 votes at one point. However, buoyed by international votes, Fujimori began to gain ground again.Fujimori, the scion of a powerful political family, said she held out hope of closing the narrow gap on Castillo on Monday night.Markets in Peru wobbled for a second day, after dipping forcefully on Monday on the expectation that Castillo would win. Peru's stock exchange fell 0.74%, although the local currency, the Sol, strengthened 0.33%.The drama has left Peruvians glued to media as they watch the tally. But the final result could still be days away, and contested ballots could be key.There are some 1,385 contested 'actas,' or voting tables, which is likely to equate to some 300,000 votes. They are set to be counted by a special committee set up by the electoral board, which could take at least a week.If Castillo wins, investors will be looking to see whether he reaches out to calm the country following the divisive election, and what his early messaging is on economic policy direction and the investment outlook, Goldman Sachs said.Castillo has promised to redraft the constitution to strengthen the role of the state and take a larger portion of profits from mining firms. Fujimori has pledged to follow a free-market model and maintain economic stability in Peru.Azhar Hussain, Head of Global Credit at Royal London Asset Management, said that market fears about Castillo were potentially over-inflated.“The (market) reaction to Peru is pretty muted,” he said. “For a start maybe we got trapped in the narrative that it was a binary choice ... Maybe from a political point of view it is, but from a real economic perspective it doesn’t seem to be.”Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1

"Peter Schiff: Americans Are Worried About Inflation If you’ve been to the grocery store, or the gas station, or the building supply store, you know we have an inflation problem. Last month’s hotter than expected CPI confirmed what we already intuitively know. But the folks over at the Federal Reserve continue to tell us there’s nothing to worry about. They insist inflation is transitory. Their reassurances notwithstanding, people are worried. Searches for the word “inflation” hit an all-time high on Google trends in May. In this clip from a recent podcast, Peter Schiff talked about the growing public worry about inflation and why the Fed’s response is bogus. According to Google Trends, searches for the word “inflation” hit the highest level since 2004 between May 9 and May 15. That’s as far back as the data goes. Google charts trends numerically and during that time period interest in “inflation” went all the way up to 100. “If you look all the way from 2004 until the end of 2020, pretty much all the searches were pretty consistent at about 50. And now, in the beginning of 2021, is where we shot up from 50 all the way up to 100. So, something changed in 2021 that resulted in all these people all over the United States deciding independently that they were going to search inflation.” So, why are they doing that? “Well, because they’re worried about it! If it was transitory, would they care? They care because it doesn’t seem like it’s transitory.” On the other hand, the Federal Reserve continues to ignore the signs that inflation is here to stay and pretends it’s transitory. “We can’t just pretend and play make-believe and hope the problem goes away. Because they tried that with the mortgage problem. Even though it was obvious that subprime was the tip of a huge iceberg, the Fed kept saying, ‘Don’t worry. It’s contained,’ because they were hoping that if they denied the problem, maybe it would go away. Well, they’re doing the same thing again with inflation. They’re telling all the people who are so worried about inflation, ‘Hey, don’t worry about it because it’s just transitory.’ Well, it’s as transitory as subprime was contained.” In fact, the Fed is driving inflation through its monetary policy and debt monetization. Through the first 7 months of fiscal 2021, the US government collected about $2.1 trillion in taxes but spent about $4.1 trillion. “That means $2 trillion was borrowed and basically funded by the Federal Reserve. And these are the official numbers. The unofficial numbers are even worse.” And consider this: the deficit through the first 7 months of 2021 is higher than the first 7 months of 2020, which included the depth of the COVID recession. “The government is spending even more money and running even bigger deficits now, when the economy is supposedly in recovery, than it was when it was still in recession, which again proves that there isn’t a recovery at all. It’s phony. The only reason the economy looks like it’s recovering is because the Fed is printing all this money to artificially stimulate it. But the way you see the truth is to look at the increase in prices that the Fed is still denying exist. They don’t want to acknowledge that inflation is not transitory because then they have to acknowledge that it’s the recovery that’s transitory because it doesn’t actually exist and inflation is going to kill it.” This puts the Fed in an awkward position. Typically, the cure for a recession is inflation. But how can the Fed cure a recession caused by inflation by creating more inflation? “The hair of the dog that bit you isn’t going to work. It’s just going to make the economy sicker.” Alex Jones breaks down critical intel regarding Covid-19 and the infamous Wuhan lab.",0,0

Our Country can’t take this abuse anymore!” On Friday, Facebook vice president of global affairs Nick Clegg told Politico the president’s account would be suspended for two years after the company claimed he incited violence on Jan. 6. “We are suspending his accounts for two years, effective from the date of the initial suspension on January 7 this year,” Clegg told Politico. “Given the gravity of the circumstances that led to Mr. Trump’s suspension, we believe his actions constituted a severe violation of our rules which merit the highest penalty available under the new enforcement protocols,” he added. Fortunately, there’s a major silver lining in that timetable for Trump, according to Politico. The social media giant said after that period it would evaluate whether “the risk to public safety has receded,” and then make a call on his possible reinstatement. Facebook said that when the suspension is “eventually” lifted, Trump could face a new set of sanctions if he breaks the social network’s rules again, ranging from one month to a potential permanent ban depending on severity of offense.The timetable means Trump could return to the platform ahead of a potential 2024 presidential run, a prospect he has teased he’s considering.

"French lecturer reaches for stars with astronaut application In a break from his job teaching engineering to students in France's Normandy region, Matthieu Pluvinage put the finishing touches on an application for a new job: astronaut.Pluvinage, 38, is taking advantage of a European Space Agency initiative to run an open recruitment drive for new astronauts for its manned flight programme.While he has never been a test pilot or served in the military - typical credentials for astronauts in the past - he ticks many of the boxes in the job description.He has a masters degree in science, he speaks English and French, he reckons he is fit enough to pass the medical, and he has a passion for space.""There are things that make me think, 'I want to do this! It's cool!',"" said Pluvinage in his office at the ESIGELEC engineering school near Rouen, 140 km (90 miles) west of Paris, where he teaches.Pluvinage has a collection of books about Thomas Pesquet, the space engineer and airline pilot who this year became the first French commander of the International Space Station.Displayed on a computer monitor was his job application, still being drafted. He has until June 18 to submit it, and will know the result in October.The odds are long. He has not yet even entered the recruitment process. Competition will be stiff. To succeed, Pluvinage will need to get through six selection rounds.But he said he decided to take the risk because the next time the space agency puts out an open call for new astronauts, likely to be years from now, he may be too old.""No matter the result, if I don't try it, I will have regrets for the rest of my life,"" he said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,0
"School Principal & Mobile Vaccine Bus Served With Notice of Liability For Pushing COVID Shot On Students A Hawaii school principal and his “vaccine supervisor” were served a Cease and Desist letter for attempting to administer the COVID-19 jab to students on campus. Radford High School principal James Sunday had approved of a vaccine campaign on school campus using a mobility clinic called the “Vax Squad” bus to inoculate the students with Pfizer’s COVID vaccine to students. Sunday and the “Vax Squad” supervisor named John received the Notice of Liability letter from the Council for Restorative Justice – a parental watchdog group – last month, explaining that they’ve violated a plethora of ethics codes for “unlawfully playing doctor” and failing to adequately provide informed consent. “In summation for the school campus staff along with ‘Vax Squad Bus’ administers, you are in breach of unlawful conversion of a tax-paying public-school facility licensed for the administering of education, not medication, and turning public school grounds into a medical treatment facility where drugs are being disseminated and inoculations performed,” the letter states. “You are in breach of not only turning public school grounds into medical treatment centers, but in breach of campaigning to adolescents, minors, youth, underaged children, sons and daughters, ages 17 and under, to receiving medical treatments.” “You are manipulating the medical decision of a minor, an underaged son or daughter,” the letter continues. “In addition to presenting false and misleading information about medical treatments, you are providing incentives and rewards, and coercive tactics to manipulate the minds of the minor to receiving these so-called ‘vaccines’ without giving full disclosure of all the potential risks of harm including death.” “It is imperative this program to facilitate the inoculations of the so-called COVID-19 “vaccine” be halted immediately and all decisions to expose any adolescents 17 and under, be arrested immediately,” the letter concludes. The letter includes a thorough breakdown of the legal, ethical, and constitutional violations brought about by promoting the Vax Squad to students, which can be read in detail below.

"China’s vast foreign reserves grow to $3.22 TRILLION Chinese gold and foreign currency reserves, the world’s largest, rose more than expected last month, according to official data published on Monday. The nation’s foreign exchange reserves increased by $23.62 billion to $3.22 trillion in May against $3.208 trillion seen in a Reuters poll of analysts and $3.198 trillion recorded in April. The growth is partially attributed to the weakened US dollar. The Chinese national currency, the yuan, rose 1.6% against the greenback in May, while the dollar dropped 1.6% during last month versus a basket of other major currencies. China’s gold holdings stood at 62.64 million fine troy ounces at the end of May, unchanged from the previous month. The value of the gold reserves surged to $119.02 billion at the end of May from $110.73 billion in late April. The world’s largest forex reserves continued to rise as China has been gradually recovering from the pandemic-related crisis. Last month, the country’s imports grew at their fastest pace in 10 years, fueled by surging demand for raw materials. However, export growth slowed more than expected, weighed by disruptions caused by Covid-19 cases at the country’s major southern ports.",0,1

I will tell you, it was always on my mind. I know it was on Tony Fauci’s mind.” Collins said, “I think it was a confusing time back then [early 2020], Judy. First, let me say, I do think we need to get answers here. An investigation is very much needed.” He added that back then, there was the theory that the virus was the result of bioweapons research, which wasn’t a viable theory, adding, “And so the idea that it was, on the other hand, a lab accident, where they were studying this virus, which maybe did occur in nature, but it got loose in the lab, that theory didn’t get nearly as much attention perhaps as it should have. I will tell you, it was always on my mind. I know it was on Tony Fauci’s mind. But none of us ran to the microphone to say, we need to worry about the fact that this could have been a lab leak.

"‘No Trust’: Top Republican Kevin McCarthy Calls for Fauci’s Resignation Amid COVID-19 Email Leak Dr Fauci has previously rejected the idea of his National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases possibly sharing responsibility for the COVID-19 pandemic. US Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has become the latest GOP lawmaker to call out Dr Anthony Fauci, the chief medical adviser to the US president. Asked if the US top COVID-19 doctor should resign or be fired from his role as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, McCarthy said “yeah, because you do not have the trust in him”. “The American people don’t have trust in Dr Fauci. Let’s find a person we can trust. Take politics aside, I mean we’re talking about American lives here”, McCarthy said on the Breitbart News Saturday radio show. Dr Anthony Fauci has recently been facing calls from Republican lawmakers to be fired. On Saturday, Republican House Representative Matt Gaetz claimed in an interview that Dr Fauci “has blood on his hands”, and days earlier two top House Republicans said it was “imperative” for Fauci, to testify before congressional committees and provide information related to the origins of COVID-19. The US COVID-19 tsar has faced increasing criticism lately over a $600,000 grant that went to the EcoHealth Alliance and ended up at the Wuhan lab in China, from which, according to growing speculation, the disease could have escaped. The criticism of Dr Fauci has also been fuelled by the recent release by BuzzFeed of 3,200 pages of the chief medical adviser’s emails dating back to the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. In one of the alleged emails, Peter Daszak, head of the EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit organisation with ties to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, reportedly thanked Fauci for downplaying the possibility that COVID-19 had escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Fauci, however, recently said that the revelations in those papers, suggesting he was warned at the very outset of the pandemic that COVID-19 might have been “engineered”, had been “taken out of context”. In March, the World Health Organisation released the full version of its report on the origins of the coronavirus, in which the WHO called a leak of COVID-19 from a laboratory very unlikely. The report also suggested that the virus was most likely transmitted to humans from bats via another animal. Recently, however, US President Joe Biden ordered members of the US intelligence community to produce a report in 90 days to put an end to the debate over whether the coronavirus had spread to humans from animals naturally or if it leaked from a laboratory in China, promising to release the report in full. Hours after Biden’s statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said that the agency did not know the exact origins of the coronavirus at the time. The speculation that COVID-19 could be man-made has been circulating for more than a year, with the former Donald Trump administration repeatedly claiming the disease may have originated in the Wuhan lab. The president himself referred to COVID-19 as the “China virus”, while Beijing consistently rejected the allegations.

"The Economics of the Extended Family: From Risk Management to Human Capital When we think of analyzing economic organizations, we generally think of firms and corporations. But there is another organization that is just as critical to economic development: the extended family. Indeed, the advantages offered by this institution are numerous and include risk sharing, mutual aid, human capital building, social capital building, and resource complementarity and coordination. Risk Sharing and Mutual Aid One of the most important roles of the extended family is to act as a risk-sharing organization. Life is unpredictable. In a nuclear family separated from the extended family, the parents only have one another to rely upon. A single accident, sudden illness, job loss, etc. reduces half of the productive capacity of this unit and can spell disaster for both spouses and their dependent children. This is where grandparents, uncles, aunts, and even family friends and close neighbors serve a crucial societal function. The members of this large group can chip in when things are going well for them to help their family members who are going through hard times. And those who contribute know that if one day it’s their turn to go through a rough patch, the rest of the extended family, with its large collective pool of resources, will be there to get them through it, too. This works like and is a supplement to insurance purchased on the market, except that in the extended family there’s an affectionate thumb on the actuary’s scale. Moving from a small group like the nuclear family to a larger group like the extended family protects against risk, because while it only takes one misfortune for half of a nuclear family to be debilitated, it would be an unlikely coincidence for half of a thirty-person extended family to simultaneously be stricken by misfortunes. The mutual-aid capacity of the extended family doesn’t just apply to extraordinary cases such as sudden illness, unemployment, or death, but also to everyday matters such as taking care of the very young and the very old members of the family. We see this, for example, in the familiar case of grandparents caring for and instructing their grandchildren when the parents are at work or running errands. The extended family is like a company that provides health insurance, unemployment insurance, life insurance, childcare, and eldercare all in one and in which everyone on the board of directors loves you. Human and Social Capital The benefits hardly stop there. The extended family is also an engine of human and social capital, that is to say skills and connections that boost the career opportunities of its members. Imagine a young man, Smith, who in addition to his parents has a grandfather who runs a vineyard, another grandfather who’s a carpenter, an uncle who owns a mechanic shop, another uncle who’s a lawyer, an aunt who’s a nurse, and older cousins with their own occupations and businesses. To an outsider with no such relatives, each one of these occupational or entrepreneurial paths is to varying extents a black box. Is this the right path for me? What skills do I need? How do I get started? Who do I need to talk to? And so on. But for Smith, each of his relatives can provide an apprenticeship opportunity and be a fountain of insider knowledge and connections. The extended family members in question can offer advice, describe what the occupation is like, take him in as an intern and teach him the craft, recommend him for job openings, or hire him themselves. All of this can save Smith a world of time, money, and anxiety and missteps. According to Julia Fisher, the director of education research at the Clayton Christensen Institute, “Research shows that 70% of all jobs are not published publicly on jobs sites and as much as 80% of jobs are filled through personal and professional connections.” This shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Parents pay large sums of money for their children to make the social connections provided by elite universities, for example. Having a devoted extended family presents many of the advantages of a vocational school, country club, or recruitment agency. Complementarity of Resources In a prior article I discussed how specialization and the division of labor make the family a powerful economic unit. Jörg Guido Hülsmann provides an insight about resource complementarity within the family that extends this analysis: The generations are also different; they also complement each other. Young people typically have a large work capacity and creativity, but less experience and money. The cooperation between the generations of a family is also favored by trust and affection that has grown over many years, which still has to be built up in relation to people who are not family members. The young and the old tend to have complementary resources within the family: energy and money, respectively. There may be plenty of people in the world ready to offer money to finance investments, and there may be plenty of people in the world ready to execute business plans once they have the money for it, but solving the coordination problem of bringing together these groups of people and fostering enough trust between them to breathe life into these potential investments is a herculean task. It’s part of the reason why there’s a multitrillion-dollar global banking industry. Within extended families, the fact that the young and the old develop affection toward, trust in, and knowledge of one another helps solve this resource coordination problem. Consequently, investment ideas become actual investments. Conclusion These benefits can’t be taken for granted, however. Merely having biological grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. is not the same as being a part of a functioning extended family if this group of people is scattered across different states, or doesn’t labor to maintain warm relations and fulfill their reciprocal obligations toward one another. That’s up to us.",0,0
"Analysis: Iran nuclear deal rescue needs more time, envoys say ahead of fresh talks A host of barriers to the revival of Iran’s nuclear deal remain firmly in place ahead of talks due to resume this week between Tehran and world powers, suggesting a return to compliance with the 2015 accord is still a way off, four diplomats, two Iranian officials and two analysts say.Iranian demands about sanctions relief and Western concern over Iran's expanding nuclear know-how are among questions that may need weeks or possibly months of further negotiations, the diplomats and analysts said.The talks seek to revive a landmark pact under which Iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions, which opened the way for a brief thaw in decades of U.S.-Iranian confrontation.Then-President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018 saying it was too soft on Tehran, and reimposed sanctions. Iran responded by violating the agreement's limits.Trump's successor Joe Biden has said he wants to restore the deal's nuclear limits and if possible extend them to cover issues such as Iran's regional behaviour and missile programme. Iran wants all sanctions lifted and no expansion of the terms.European Union envoy Enrique Mora, the chief coordinator of the talks, said last week he believed a deal would be reached at the upcoming sixth round of negotiations in Vienna, expected to resume on Thursday or Friday.  read more Adding to the impetus to make progress is an election in Iran on June 18 to replace President Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist who promoted the original deal. He is widely expected to be followed by a hardline successor.The election is not likely to change Tehran's negotiating stance: regardless of who is president any deal must be approved by Iran's hardline faction through Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. But neither Washington nor Tehran wants to start from scratch, or entangle the deal further in Iranian domestic politics.Iran's top nuclear negotiator said last week that barriers to a revival of the deal are complicated but not insurmountable. ""Differences have reached a point where everyone believes these differences are not insolvable,"" Abbas Araqchi said.However, none of the remaining sticking points lend themselves to rapid solutions, according to the diplomats, Iranian officials and analysts of Iranian nuclear matters.Their assessment chimes with downbeat remarks on Monday by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said Washington still did not know whether Iran was ready to resume compliance with the deal. read more ""I doubt that the next round will be the final one... The parties are still far apart on core issues,"" said Ali Vaez, senior Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group.And when, or if, disagreements are solved, more talks would be needed on so-called sequencing - the delicate question of which side takes which action and when, in return for reciprocal steps by the other side, the diplomats said.  read more The negotiations have made considerable progress but are now at the hardest part with the key decisions still needed, said a European diplomat briefed on the talks, which began in April.'THE HEART OF THE MATTER'The talks have arrived at ""the heart of the matter on the nuclear dimension"", a second European diplomat said.A senior Western diplomat said that “of course” he hoped that the next round would result in a deal, but injected a note of caution, saying “until we are able to resolve the important issues that remain, we won’t know.”An Iranian official said: ""Everything depends on Washington. If the American side accepts to lift all sanctions, then Iran will return into full compliance with the deal.""In addition to seeking the lifting of Trump-era sanctions, Tehran also wants Washington to remove Iran's Revolutionary Guards from a terrorism blacklist, which can be used to bar Iranian businesses from the international financial system. It wants Europe to guarantee foreign investors will return, and assurances that Washington will not renege on the deal again.But from the standpoint of Washington and its European allies, it would no longer be sufficient to return to the nuclear restrictions in the orginal deal, designed at the time to ensure that Iran could not build a bomb in less than a year.In the months that Iran has been breaching the limits, it has made technical advances that make the original restrictions out of date. Vaez noted that Iran has begun using advanced centrifuges, known as the IR9, which are 50 times more powerful at producing enriched uranium than the ones covered by the deal, known by its initials as the JCPoA.BREAKOUT TIME""If Iran refuses to destroy these machines, its breakout time will be shorter, unless it agrees to dismantle an equivalent number of IR1 machines. That is seen by Iran as humiliating and beyond the JCPoA's scope,"" Vaez said.The Iranians have acquired knowledge and capabilities they did not have before, said the European diplomat briefed on the talks, citing Iran's first ever production of uranium metal, a material that can be used to make the core of an atom bomb.  read more The development, reported this year by the International Atomic Energy Agency, was not something covered by the 2015 deal, and any revival of the pact would have to take account of this new-found capability, Vaez said.Bob Einhorn, a former senior State Department official and nuclear negotiator with Iran, thought it highly unlikely that there would be an agreement before the presidential election, but conceivable one could be struck during the interim ""lame duck"" period before the new president takes office.Einhorn, now at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, said there could be some political advantage for the new Iranian president to a deal being agreed during the interim.A new president could criticize any concessions made by the current Iranian administration of President Hassan Rouhani, then later take credit for any economic boost the deal produced, he said. “So you could see a kind of logic.”Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Once a lock for ruling party, opposition make electoral gains in Mexican capital Mexico's sprawling capital has long been a bedrock of support for President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, dating back to his term as mayor years ago, but city voters shifted on Sunday, giving opponents a string of major wins, according to preliminary results.The congressional election in the country looked likely to give Lopez Obrador's allies a majority, albeit slimmed down. In Mexico City, though, his party did not fare so well in elections for borough leaders.While his leftist National Regeneration Movement, known as MORENA, held on to Mexico City's most populous boroughs, including Iztapalapa and Gustavo Madero, it lost nine of the capital's 16 districts.Lopez Obrador blamed the opposition gains on unfriendly press coverage.""You have to keep in mind that this is where there were more attacks from the media,"" said Lopez Obrador, speaking at his regular morning news conference at the national palace in downtown Mexico City.The leftist leader often lashes out at the media, which he derides as mostly elitist and overly concentrated in the capital.More outreach was needed, he said on Monday.Lopez Obrador built up his power base in the capital when he served as mayor from 2000 to 2005, and MORENA took all but four of the boroughs when Lopez Obrador swept to power three years ago in a landslide election victory.But the opposition was able to capitalize on discontent over his record since he became president. He has struggled to deliver on pledges to combat gang violence and lift anemic economic growth.Opposition politicians formed an ideologically diverse coalition to beat out ruling party candidates in the capital.The coalition is made up of the centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the center-right National Action Party (PAN), and the center-left Democratic Revolution Party (PRD), the later once the political home of Lopez Obrador.In the borough of Cuauhtemoc, MORENA's Dolores Padierna, a veteran politician once affiliated with the PRD, was down by 10% to her main coalition rival, Sandra Xantall Cuevas.But Padierna nonetheless held on to fading hopes for a turnaround late on Sunday.

This is the anti-vaccine ""expert witness"" pic.twitter.com/sPpuAqmHba— Tyler Buchanan (@Tylerjoelb) June 8, 2021 During another part of the testimony, Tenpenny mentioned the phenomenon of vaccinated people appearing to be magnetized. “I’m sure you’ve seen the pictures all over the internet of people who have had these shots and now they’re magnetized,” she told lawmakers. “They can put a key on their forehead. It sticks. They can put spoons and forks all over them and they can stick, because now we think that there’s a metal piece to that.” Tenpenny also said some people have hypothesized 5G towers could be interfacing with technology put into people’s bodies via the COVID shots. She admits that a connection between 5G and COVID vaccines is “not proven yet,” but she tries to explain scientists are working to figure out why magnetization is appearing to take place. Of course, mainstream media is attacking the doctor, claiming she “tells lawmakers COVID-19 vaccine can leave people magnetized, interfaced with 5G towers,” instead of admitting she proposed these ideas as hypotheses. For example, NBC 4 Columbus ran a report claiming Tenpenny told lawmakers the vaccine interfaces with 5G. They even claim Russian disinformation is responsible for the theory that 5G could possibly harm the immune system. Meanwhile, videos are constantly being uploaded to the internet showing people shocked to find metal objects and magnets sticking to their bodies, yet mainstream media calls these false claims.

"U.S. reunites only seven immigrant children with parents since Feb An effort by U.S. President Joe Biden to reunite migrant families separated by the previous administration is moving slowly, with only seven children reunited with parents by a task force launched in February, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report released on Tuesday.Another 29 families are set to be reunited in the coming weeks, the report said.Biden issued an executive order shortly after taking office that established a task force to reunite children separated from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border under former President Donald Trump, calling such separations a ""human tragedy.""The Trump administration split apart thousands of migrant families under a blanket 'zero-tolerance' policy that called for the prosecution of all unauthorized border crossers in spring 2018.

"World Economic Forum pushes MIT program that automatically detects “disinformation narratives” online Misinformation and propaganda are as old and as present as human communication and societies organized into states. The curiously intense focus on these the last couple of years prompts many to believe such issues are now used as justification and smokescreen for suppressing legitimate but unwanted speech, and free expression-related civil rights. Depending on where you stand on that, you may be reassured or dismayed that the World Economic Forum (WEF) is one of the entities pushing hard the agenda of online misinformation presenting a huge danger today – and endorsing some “solutions.” One comes from MIT and its “Reconnaissance of Influence Operations (RIO)” – now there’s a name George Orwell would probably not kick out of his novels. Out the gate, RIO “establishes” that power of misinformation on social networks and elsewhere online is such as to sway elections, but also allow different points of view to be expressed, or as the program announcement put it, “sow discord.” Another dangerous point the MIT program aims to address is disinformation feeding “conspiracy theories” – but in light of the recent embarrassing U-turn on the “Wuhan lab leak” there’s no evidence of a firm and consensus-based definition of what a “conspiracy” even is. Rather, the category seems prone to political whim. But RIO looks to be designed to work under the false premise that these definitions are objective, and agreed on by all stakeholders. You’d think that as far as conspiracies go, the one about Russians electing a US president by exploiting social media is the most tired and by now well-debunked one. Nevertheless, that is one of the claims to fame made by those behind RIO and MIT Lincoln Laboratory’s Artificial Intelligence Software Architectures and Algorithms Group, whose goal is not only to “automatically” detect what they deem to be disinformation, but also what their machine learning algorithms are programed to identify as “disinformation narratives.” That means the tool would recognize the level of influence of accounts not only by their size in terms of followers, but also other elements as a measure of overall impact.

"Russian court weighs pre-election knockout blow to Kremlin critic Navalny's network A Russian court on Wednesday began considering a request to declare organisations linked to jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny ""extremist"", a move that if approved would ban his allies from a parliamentary election later this year too.The case, the latest chapter in a long-running crackdown on President Vladimir Putin's fiercest domestic opponent, could deliver a final hammer blow to a vast political network that Navalny built up over years to try to challenge the veteran Russian leader's grip on power.The case is being brought by the office of Moscow's top prosecutor who has accused Navalny and his allies of trying to foment a revolution by seeking to destabilise the socio-political situation inside Russia with their activity.The legal offensive mirrors ones waged in the past against far-right groups, Islamist organisations and the Jehovah's Witnesses which were declared ""extremist"" by courts and banned.Navalny and his allies have denied the prosecutor's allegations, casting them as an attempt to try to crush their political opposition to the ruling United Russia party ahead of parliamentary elections in September.The staff of Ivan Pavlov, one of Navalny's lawyers, wrote on social media they expected the court to issue a verdict later on Wednesday.The prosecutor's request, if approved by the court, would formally end the activity of a network of groups set up by Navalny, 45, who is serving a 2-1/2 year jail term for parole violations related to an embezzlement conviction he says was trumped up.Specifically, it would target Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation which has produced high-profile investigations into alleged official corruption, and Navalny's regional campaign headquarters which have mobilised in the past to organise anti-Kremlin protests.If Russia declares the foundation and regional groups extremist, the authorities would gain the formal power to jail activists and freeze their bank accounts. The case has already prompted Navalny's allies to disband the groups.In the run-up to the hearing, Putin last week signed legislation that bars members of ""extremist"" organisations from running for office.  read more Given the court is widely expected to label Navalny's organisations extremist, the new legislation is seen as ending hopes by some Navalny allies to run for parliament later this year.They say they will try to use a smart or tactical voting strategy instead to seek to undermine support for the pro-Kremlin ruling party, a strategy Kremlin sources have belittled.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"NY School Board Member Calls Parent “A**hole” & Tries To Start A Fight During Mask/Racial Theory Meeting Footage out of New York shows a school board member calling a parent an “asshole” and trying to physically fight said parent during a Tuesday night meeting. After several parents pushed back against the Penfield Central School District’s mask policy and controversial “diversity, equity, and inclusion” curriculum, a board member named William Yeager allegedly made a dismissive gesture. When Yeager made the gesture, a mother attending the meeting asked, “What was that?” and a father named Rich Tyson requested Yeager “Be respectful.” At this point, Yeager lost control and shouted, “You’re not gonna stand up here and do anything to me, asshole!” After a parent asked NY school board member Bill Yaeger to be respectful to other parents, Yaeger told him, ""You're not gonna stand up here and do anything to me, a**hole."" The parent then confronts him & Yaeger is physicallyMasks. pic.twitter.com/xD3E25DChC— Amanda (@AmandaPresto) June 9, 2021 The crowd gasped following Yeager’s slur, and according to Tyson, “He (Yaeger) started kind of motioning for me to come toward the stage, which I did start walking, then he dropped an F-bomb on me.” Tyson told WROC, “That’s when I walked and jumped up on the stage, not to be physically confrontational, but I wanted to address it with him face to face. By the time I got there he had become essentially unhinged.” In the footage, Yeager can be seen being restrained by multiple men who he tried to fight off for nearly a minute. Speaking to The Daily Wire, Tyson said he thinks Yeager “would have taken a shot at me” if he broke free. “The superintendent, Dr. [Thomas] Putnam, and a few other board members were basically having to restrain him,” Tyson explained. “He was like, you know, ‘I’m going to take you outside’ kind of stuff. And I just basically went up there to tell him ‘you’re not being respectful, you’re not representing us, and get the hell out of here, get out of this board meeting.’” The father added, “I’m a passionate parent and there were many others in the room and we all felt kind of disrespected by his cavalier attitude toward our comments.” News 8 WROC reported on the incident in the video below.",0,0
"No Need to Vaccinate People Who’ve Previously Had Covid, Study Finds There’s no need for people who’ve had the Covid-19 virus to get vaccinated, a new study from the Cleveland Clinic finds. In the study published at MedRxiv, Cleveland Clinic researchers evaluated whether those who have not yet been infected by the virus should be prioritized to receive the vaccine. Sampling 52,238 employees of the Cleveland Clinic Health System, researchers compared previously infected subjects who received the vaccine with previously infected subjects who had not received the vaccine, as well as two other control groups. Explanation of “previously infected” analyzed as a time-independent covariate and “vaccinated” treated as a time-dependent covariate. The study concluded that: “Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who have not been infected before.” The study also observed that those previously infected, whether vaccinated or not, did not get re-infected. “Although the study did not directly estimate the duration of protection from natural infection, it was observed that previously infected participants remained protected against COVID-19 for at least 10 months after the symptom onset or a positive test result,” reports News-Medical.net. The study’s findings will no doubt bolster the opinions of people who reject the vaccine because they’ve recently had Covid and recovered. The justification was used recently by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (R), who publicly stated he wouldn’t be taking the vaccine because he already had Covid. “I just made my own personal decision that I’m not getting vaccinated, because I’ve already had the disease, and I have natural immunity,” Paul said. It remains to be seen if the Big Pharma medical establishment and its lapdog media cohorts will attempt to spin, debunk, or ignore the study.

"NATO Chief Says Org Does NOT See China as Adversary, Will Include Beijing in New Strategy NATO does not consider China to be an adversary but will include the country in its New Strategic Concept for the first time ever, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday. “China is asserting itself on the global stage. NATO does not see China as an adversary. There are opportunities to engage with Beijing [on] issues like trade, climate change, and arms control”, Stoltenberg said during a virtual event organised by the Brookings Institution. “In the existing strategic concept of NATO, we don’t mention China with one single word. I can guarantee one thing that in the New Strategic Concept, China will be mentioned”. Stoltenberg noted that the future communique during the upcoming NATO summit on 14 June will contain “much more language” on China than ever before, including specific decisions that will address Beijing’s technological advances and ways to protect NATO member states’ key infrastructure against possible cyber threats. In addition, Stoltenberg said NATO recognises the shift in the global balance of power as a result of the rise of China that has caused a number of security issues, including the fact the alliance has become more important to the United States.

"The War Over Genetic Privacy Is Just Beginning “When you upload your DNA, you’re potentially becoming a genetic informant on the rest of your family.”— Law professor Elizabeth Joh. “Guilt by association” has taken on new connotations in the technological age. All of those fascinating, genealogical searches that allow you to trace your family tree by way of a DNA sample can now be used against you and those you love. As of 2019, more than 26 million people had added their DNA to ancestry databases. It’s estimated those databases could top 100 million profiles within the year, thanks to the aggressive marketing of companies such as Ancestry and 23andMe. It’s a tempting proposition: provide some mega-corporation with a spit sample or a cheek swab, and in return, you get to learn everything about who you are, where you came from, and who is part of your extended your family. The possibilities are endless. You could be the fourth cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth II of England. Or the illegitimate grandchild of an oil tycoon. Or the sibling of a serial killer. Without even realizing it, by submitting your DNA to an ancestry database, you’re giving the police access to the genetic makeup, relationships and health profiles of every relative—past, present and future—in your family, whether or not they ever agreed to be part of such a database. After all, a DNA print reveals everything about “who we are, where we come from, and who we will be.” It’s what police like to refer to a “modern fingerprint.” Whereas fingerprint technology created a watershed moment for police in their ability to “crack” a case, DNA technology is now being hailed by law enforcement agencies as the magic bullet in crime solving. Indeed, police have begun using ancestry databases to solve cold cases that have remained unsolved for decades. For instance, in 2018, former police officer Joseph DeAngelo was flagged as the notorious “Golden State Killer” through the use of genetic genealogy, which allows police to match up an unknown suspect’s crime scene DNA with that of any family members in a genealogy database. Police were able to identify DeAngelo using the DNA of a distant cousin found in a public DNA database. Once police narrowed the suspect list to DeAngelo, they tracked him—snatched up a tissue he had tossed in a trash can—and used his DNA on the tissue to connect him to a rash of rapes and murders from the 1970s and ‘80s. Although DeAngelo was the first public arrest made using forensic genealogy, police have identified more than 150 suspects since then. Most recently, police relied on genetic genealogy to nab the killer of a 15-year-old girl who was stabbed to death nearly 50 years ago. Who wouldn’t want to get psychopaths and serial rapists off the streets and safely behind bars, right? At least, that’s the argument being used by law enforcement to support their unrestricted access to these genealogy databases. “In the interest of public safety, don’t you want to make it easy for people to be caught? Police really want to do their job. They’re not after you. They just want to make you safe,” insists Colleen Fitzpatrick, a co-founder of the DNA Doe Project, which identifies unknown bodies and helps find suspects in old crimes. Except it’s not just psychopaths and serial rapists who get caught up in the investigative dragnet. Anyone who comes up as a possible DNA match—including distant family members—suddenly becomes part of a circle of suspects that must be tracked, investigated and ruled out. Although a number of states had forbidden police from using government databases to track family members of suspects, the genealogy websites provided a loophole that proved irresistible to law enforcement. Hoping to close that loophole, a few states have started introducing legislation to restrict when and how police use these genealogical databases, with Maryland requiring that they can only be used for serious violent crimes such as murder and rape, only after they exhaust other investigatory methods, and only under the supervision of a judge. Yet the debate over genetic privacy—and when one’s DNA becomes a public commodity outside the protection of the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on warrantless searches and seizures—is really only beginning. Certainly, it’s just a matter of time before the government gets hold of our DNA, either through mandatory programs carried out in connection with law enforcement and corporate America, by warrantlessly accessing our familial DNA shared with genealogical services such as Ancestry and 23andMe, or through the collection of our “shed” or “touch” DNA. According to research published in the journal Science, more than 60 percent of Americans who have some European ancestry can be identified using DNA databases, even if they have not submitted their own DNA. According to law professor Natalie Ram, one genealogy profile can lead to as many as 300 other people. That’s just on the commercial side. All 50 states now maintain their own DNA databases, although the protocols for collection differ from state to state. Increasingly, many of the data from local databanks are being uploaded to CODIS (Combined DNA Index System), the FBI’s massive DNA database, which has become a de facto way to identify and track the American people from birth to death. Even hospitals have gotten in on the game by taking and storing newborn babies’ DNA, often without their parents’ knowledge or consent. It’s part of the government’s mandatory genetic screening of newborns. In many states, the DNA is stored indefinitely. What this means for those being born today is inclusion in a government database that contains intimate information about who they are, their ancestry, and what awaits them in the future, including their inclinations to be followers, leaders or troublemakers. Get ready, folks, because the government— helped along by Congress (which adopted legislation allowing police to collect and test DNA immediately following arrests), President Trump (who signed the Rapid DNA Act into law), the courts (which have ruled that police can routinely take DNA samples from people who are arrested but not yet convicted of a crime), and local police agencies (which are chomping at the bit to acquire this new crime-fighting gadget)—has embarked on a diabolical campaign to create a nation of suspects predicated on a massive national DNA database. Referred to as “magic boxes,” Rapid DNA machines—portable, about the size of a desktop printer, highly unregulated, far from fool-proof, and so fast that they can produce DNA profiles in less than two hours—allow police to go on fishing expeditions for any hint of possible misconduct using DNA samples. Journalist Heather Murphy explains: “As police agencies build out their local DNA databases, they are collecting DNA not only from people who have been charged with major crimes but also, increasingly, from people who are merely deemed suspicious, permanently linking their genetic identities to criminal databases.” The ramifications of these DNA databases are far-reaching. At a minimum, they will do away with any semblance of privacy or anonymity. The lucrative possibilities for hackers and commercial entities looking to profit off one’s biological record are endless. Moreover, while much of the public debate, legislative efforts and legal challenges in recent years have focused on the protocols surrounding when police can legally collect a suspect’s DNA (with or without a search warrant and whether upon arrest or conviction), the question of how to handle “shed” or “touch” DNA has largely slipped through without much debate or opposition. As scientist Leslie A. Pray notes: We all shed DNA, leaving traces of our identity practically everywhere we go. Forensic scientists use DNA left behind on cigarette butts, phones, handles, keyboards, cups, and numerous other objects, not to mention the genetic content found in drops of bodily fluid, like blood and semen. In fact, the garbage you leave for curbside pickup is a potential gold mine of this sort of material. All of this shed or so-called abandoned DNA is free for the taking by local police investigators hoping to crack unsolvable cases. Or, if the future scenario depicted at the beginning of this article is any indication, shed DNA is also free for inclusion in a secret universal DNA databank. What this means is that if you have the misfortune to leave your DNA traces anywhere a crime has been committed, you’ve already got a file somewhere in some state or federal database—albeit it may be a file without a name. As Heather Murphy warns in the New York Times: “The science-fiction future, in which police can swiftly identify robbers and murderers from discarded soda cans and cigarette butts, has arrived… Genetic fingerprinting is set to become as routine as the old-fashioned kind.” Even old samples taken from crime scenes and “cold” cases are being unearthed and mined for their DNA profiles. Today, helped along by robotics and automation, DNA processing, analysis and reporting takes far less time and can bring forth all manner of information, right down to a person’s eye color and relatives. Incredibly, one company specializes in creating “mug shots” for police based on DNA samples from unknown “suspects” which are then compared to individuals with similar genetic profiles. If you haven’t yet connected the dots, let me point the way. Having already used surveillance technology to render the entire American populace potential suspects, DNA technology in the hands of government will complete our transition to a suspect society in which we are all merely waiting to be matched up with a crime. No longer can we consider ourselves innocent until proven guilty. Now we are all suspects in a DNA lineup until circumstances and science say otherwise. Suspect Society, meet the American police state. Every dystopian sci-fi film we’ve ever seen is suddenly converging into this present moment in a dangerous trifecta between science, technology and a government that wants to be all-seeing, all-knowing and all-powerful. By tapping into your phone lines and cell phone communications, the government knows what you say. By uploading all of your emails, opening your mail, and reading your Facebook posts and text messages, the government knows what you write. By monitoring your movements with the use of license plate readers, surveillance cameras and other tracking devices, the government knows where you go. By churning through all of the detritus of your life—what you read, where you go, what you say—the government can predict what you will do. By mapping the synapses in your brain, scientists—and in turn, the government—will soon know what you remember. And by accessing your DNA, the government will soon know everything else about you that they don’t already know: your family chart, your ancestry, what you look like, your health history, your inclination to follow orders or chart your own course, etc. Of course, none of these technologies are foolproof. Nor are they immune from tampering, hacking or user bias. Nevertheless, they have become a convenient tool in the hands of government agents to render null and void the Constitution’s requirements of privacy and its prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures. What this amounts to is a scenario in which we have little to no defense of against charges of wrongdoing, especially when “convicted” by technology, and even less protection against the government sweeping up our DNA in much the same way it sweeps up our phone calls, emails and text messages. With the entire governmental system shifting into a pre-crime mode aimed at detecting and pursuing those who “might” commit a crime before they have an inkling, let alone an opportunity, to do so, it’s not so far-fetched to imagine a scenario in which government agents (FBI, local police, etc.) target potential criminals based on their genetic disposition to be a “troublemaker” or their relationship to past dissenters. Equally disconcerting: if scientists can, using DNA, track salmon across hundreds of square miles of streams and rivers, how easy will it be for government agents to not only know everywhere we’ve been and how long we were at each place but collect our easily shed DNA and add it to the government’s already burgeoning database? Not to be overlooked, DNA evidence is not infallible: it can be wrong, either through human error, tampering, or even outright fabrication, and it happens more often than we are told. The danger, warns scientist Dan Frumkin, is that crime scenes can be engineered with fabricated DNA. Now if you happen to be the kind of person who trusts the government implicitly and refuses to believe it would ever do anything illegal or immoral, then the prospect of government officials—police, especially—using fake DNA samples to influence the outcome of a case might seem outlandish. Yet as history shows, the probability of our government acting in a way that is not only illegal but immoral becomes less a question of “if” and more a question of “when.” With technology, the courts, the corporations and Congress conspiring to invade our privacy on a cellular level, suddenly the landscape becomes that much more dystopian. As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, this is the slippery slope toward a dystopian world in which there is nowhere to run and nowhere to hide.

"Watch: Vaccinated People SHOCKED When Magnet Sticks to Injection Site Remarkable footage uploaded to Banned.video proves a bizarre magnetic side effect is happening to some people who receive the Covid-19 vaccine. In a video report by The Liberty Broadcast, the crew tests whether a refrigerator magnet will stick to Covid-19 vaccine injection sites, as demonstrated in countless viral videos on social media. The theory had reportedly been debunked according to Newsweek and other mainstream outlets; however, when tested on vaccinated bar goers visiting Austin’s famous Sixth Street, the magnet sticks to them. “The magnets appear to stick to the arm on the site where the COVID-19 vaccine shot was allegedly administered (apparently proving the microchip conspiracy theory). But experts told Newsweek that a magnet will not stick to someone’s arm because of the injection,” Newsweek wrote last month. Meanwhile, the exact same phenomenon is being witnessed and documented across the globe. As the side effect continues to be proven real, it begs the question: why is the establishment trying to hide it? One reason could be that news of a magnetized vaccine injection site would likely alarm people and discourage them from seeking the vaccine. A more sinister motive, however, could be that the medical establishment is trying to keep the public in the dark that the vaccines contain magnetized proteins synthesized for mass mind control. Whatever the reason, the random street experiment above proves the phenomenon is definitely happening to certain vaccinated members of the population.

"Pharmacist Who Sabotaged COVID Vaccines After Claiming They Could Alter People’s DNA Jailed for Three Years A Wisconsin pharmacist will spend three years behind bars after pleading guilty to sabotaging hundreds of Moderna Covid-19 shots. The man confessed to trying to destroy the vaccines, claiming that they were not safe. Steven Brandenburg was jailed for three years and ordered to pay $83,800 in compensation to his former employer after he “purposefully removed” a box of Moderna vaccine vials from a hospital refrigerator during two successive night shifts in late December 2020, the Justice Department said in a statement. It’s believed that he tampered with more than 500 doses of the drug. Before his conduct was discovered, 57 people were administered doses from the spoiled vials, which need to be stored at a specific temperature to remain effective. During his sentencing on Tuesday, Brandenburg told US District Judge Brett Ludwig that he was “desperately sorry and ashamed” for his actions. Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton of the DOJ’s Civil Division said that Brandenburg’s efforts to destroy vaccine doses during a national public health emergency were a “serious crime” and that authorities would stay vigilant in order to protect “life-saving vaccines” from other acts of sabotage. In February, Brandenburg pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to tamper with consumer products. In his plea agreement, the defendant acknowledged that he was skeptical of the Moderna vaccine, and had shared his beliefs about the drug with co-workers. According to police, Brandenburg believed that the vaccine was unsafe and could change people’s DNA. Court records from Brandenburg’s divorce detail how his estranged wife told law enforcement that he was an “admitted conspiracy theorist” who believes that “the government is planning cyberattacks and plans to shut down the power grid.” More than 124 million doses of the Moderna vaccine have been administered in the United States, after government regulators approved its use in late December. While intentional sabotage appears to be a rare occurrence, there have been several cases where vaccine doses have been improperly stored, causing headaches for health officials. In January, a janitor is said to have accidentally spoiled 1,900 doses of the Moderna vaccine after unplugging a freezer at a Boston pharmacy.

"Scientist At Center Of Lab Leak Controversy Put In Charge Of The Lancet’s Task Force To Investigate Virus Origin Revered scientific journal The Lancet has created a ‘task force’ to investigate the origins of the coronavirus that caused a global pandemic, yet it has decided to employ as its leader the very guy who funded the dangerous gain of function research at the Wuhan lab and subsequently allegedly ‘bullied’ other scientists into avoiding looking into the lab as a potential source of the outbreak. In the wake of renewed scrutiny of the lab leak hypothesis, the Lancet’s task force will reportedly “focus on analyzing data on all of the theories put forward on the origins of COVID, on the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 was able to break out of Wuhan and spread globally, and on the most plausible strategies to prevent future pandemics.” It also states that “The Task Force will review thoroughly and objectively all publicly available evidence, particularly the peer-reviewed literature, and conduct interviews with key leaders in science, medicine, policy and civil society.” ‘Objectively’. Right. Dr Peter Daszak, who is heading up this task force, is perhaps the least suitable scientist on the planet to objectively analyse the data, given his track record. Daszak, as President of the EcoHealth Alliance, shovelled at least $600,000 to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the past few years to play around with coronaviruses inside the lab through the now infamous ‘gain of function’ research. Daszak, who also works for the World Health Organisation, is on record admitting that he was involved with manipulating coronaviruses. Here is a video of him talking in DECEMBER 2019 about how ‘good’ the viruses are for altering in a lab: Daszak notes that “coronaviruses are pretty good… you can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily… the spiked proteins drive a lot about what happens. You can get the sequence you can build the protein, we work with Ralph Baric at UNC to do this, insert into the backbone of another virus and do some work in a lab.” No wonder then that Daszak as lead investigator for the WHO investigation determined within 3 hours of visiting the Wuhan lab in February 2021 that there was ‘nothing to see here’? Recently released emails now document that Daszak thanked Dr Fauci for dismissing the lab leak theory before any scientific research had been done on the possibility. Daszak was later employed as an ‘expert fact checker’ by Facebook when it was monitoring and removing ‘misinformation’ about the origins of COVID on its platform, much of which was credible scientific research. Facebook has since reversed the policy of banning any posts containing information suggesting COVID-19 was “man-made”. Daszak’s Twitter profile is basically one long ‘it came from bats not a lab’ thread, much to the annoyance of some other scientists: Having approved the awarding of NIH funding to Wuhan Institute of Virology–twice–Fauci has a massive conflict of interest on subject.Failure to disclose this conflict of interest represents journalistic malpractice.— Richard H. Ebright (@R_H_Ebright) May 5, 2020 Why does this guy keep getting put in charge of investigations, task forces and ‘fact checking’, when it’s abundantly clear that he has the biggest motive to dismiss the lab leak notion? As microbiologist Professor Richard Ebright has noted, “Daszak was the contractor who funded the laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology that potentially was the source of the virus with subcontracts from $200million [£142million] from the US Department of State and $7million [£5million] from the US National Institutes of Health and he was a collaborator and co-author on research projects at the laboratory.” Daszak has already lied about the type of research that was being conducted at the Wuhan lab, claiming, after the outbreak happened, that he didn’t know if it was gain of function or not. His own previous statements, and the Fauci emails prove he knew full well what was going on in the lab. In addition, as reported by The Daily Mail and other outlets, Daszak “orchestrated a ‘bullying’ campaign and coerced top scientists into signing off on a letter to The Lancet aimed at removing blame for Covid-19 from the Wuhan lab he was funding with US money.” Daszak used his influence to get the journal to publish the letter, which stated that to even suggest the lab leak theory had any credibility was equal to spreading “fear, rumours, and prejudice.” It effetely shut down discussion among the scientific ‘consensus’ of the lab leak potential for a whole year until intelligence findings brought the matter back to the attention of the mainstream media. WHO scientific advisor Jamie Metzl described Daszak’s letter as “scientific propaganda and a form of thuggery and intimidation.” “By labelling anyone with different views a conspiracy theorist, the Lancet letter was the worst form of bullying in full contravention of the scientific method,” Metzl added. The letter further stated that “We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin,” and even had the audacity to state that “We declare no competing interests.” Indeed, Daszak had made sure that the letter would be devoid of any link to EcoHealth, and even considered leaving his own name off it, emails released via the Freedom of Information Act have revealed. To make matters worse, the other members of The Lancet’s task force are practically all minions of Daszak, some of whom helped him draft the letter that unequivocally stated the lab leak theory was dangerous, and others who either worked with him on ‘fact checking’ for Facebook, or were cited as sources during that activity. Taking all this into account, it is obvious what the outcome of The Lancet’s inquiry will be, and it should not and cannot be used as credible evidence against the lab leak theory. ——————————————————————————————————————— ALERT!

"Giuliani pressed Ukrainians to probe Biden allegations in 2019 call - CNN The audiotape of a July 2019 phone call shows former U.S. President Donald Trump’s then-lawyer Rudy Giuliani pressuring Ukrainian officials to investigate baseless allegations about Trump’s 2020 election rival Joe Biden, CNN reported on Monday.CNN said it had obtained the audio of the call between Giuliani, U.S. diplomat Kurt Volker, and Andriy Yermak, a senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy which it said was the precursor of a Trump-Zelenskiy call which was at the center of Trump's 2019 impeachment.In the call, Giuliani said he wanted Zelenskiy to say he was putting a prosecutor in charge and ""he's gonna investigate and dig up the evidence, that presently exists and is there any other evidence about involvement of the 2016 election, and then the Biden thing has to be run out,"" according to CNN.Trump, a Republican, denounced as a political witch hunt allegations that he pressed Zelenskiy during a phone call to dig up dirt on Biden. The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump in December 2019, but he was acquitted by the then-Republican-dominated Senate early in 2020.Trump lost the 2020 election to Biden, a Democrat, and left office in January 2021.In April, federal prosecutors investigating Giuliani’s business dealings in Ukraine at the time he was serving as Trump’s lawyer raided his home and office, seizing cell phones and computers. Giuliani, a former New York City mayor, has not been charged. He said after the raids that his conduct had been ""absolutely legal and ethical.""Giuliani began representing Trump in April 2018 in connection with then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,1
"Twitter bans Naomi Wolf Feminist author and journalist Naomi Wolf has been permanently banned on Twitter for posts about COVID-19, vaccines, and vaccine passports. Some have applauded the ban, while others see it as another example of Big Tech’s suppression of free speech. Wolf is considered one of the most prominent feminists, rising to fame after publishing the book The Beauty Myth. In the past year, however, she has been the subject of criticism as well as support for her strong stance against lockdowns, vaccine passports, and COVID-19 vaccines themselves. Wolf had already been censored by Twitter prior to her ban. At the 2021 Bitcoin conference, Jack Dorsey was confronted by Laura Loomer on his censorship and human rights abuses. Many criticized the ban, describing it as a blow to the freedom of expression and claiming it was the result of pressure from the US government. Twitter said the ban was permanent and would not allow Wolf to appeal it. In a recent congressional hearing, Wolf argued against vaccine passports, saying they would “re-create a situation that is very familiar to me as a student of history. This has been the start of many, many genocides.”",0,1

"Thousands of nurses go on strike in New Zealand About 30,000 nurses in New Zealand walked off their jobs on Wednesday in a nationwide eight-hour strike after negotiations with the government for better pay and working conditions failed.The strike action came after the New Zealand Nurses Organisation (NZNO) rejected a 1.4% pay hike proposed by the District Health Board earlier this week. The government says the nurses' demands amounted to a 17% increase that it can't afford, but pledged to continue negotiations.The stand-off comes as Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern faces criticism for not doing enough to address rising inequality, despite the economy bouncing back from the COVID-19 pandemic more swiftly than expected.Thousands of nurses marched on the streets holding placards, while others gathered at parks and outside hospitals around the country.""Nurses are the glue who hold care services together,"" Dr Julian Vyas, president of Association of Salaried Medical Specialists said, according to online news portal Newshub.""If they are on strike, you can be sure there's a big problem which needs to be fixed,"" he added.Nurses have complained of being underpaid and burnt out, with conditions worsening with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic.Current pay rates do not attract people into the profession or retain the people, and staffing levels have stretched them to breaking point, putting them and their patients at risk, NZNO has said in a statement.""""We stood during the pandemic. The nurses have put their lives at risk, and that of their families. And this is the thanks that we are given,"" Diane McCulloch, Clinical Nurse Specialist told Newshub.All non-urgent surgeries and outpatient clinics were cancelled.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",1,0
"England’s Lockdown Could Continue Despite Deaths Being Below 5 Year Average England’s lockdown measures could remain in place beyond the supposed “freedom day” on June 21st despite the fact that for 11 out of the last 12 weeks, deaths have been below the 5 year average. Yes, really. As LockdownSkeptics.org highlights, “(the) ONS announced that there were 9,628 deaths in England and Wales in the week ending 28th May 2021. This is 232 fewer than the previous week, and 3.1% below the five-year average.” “Deaths in England and Wales have now been below the five-year average for 11 of the past 12 weeks. Over that time, there were 8,212 fewer deaths than you’d expect based on the average of the last five years. And note that, due to population ageing, the five-year average understates the expected number of deaths. So the true level of “negative excess mortality” is even higher.” The number of registered deaths in the week ending May 28 is also lower than the 5 year average in seven out of nine English regions, including the population-dense South East. Oh. pic.twitter.com/CylcWsjWQ3 — Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) June 9, 2021 June 21st was the day when all COVID-19 restrictions were supposed to be lifted, but more and more indications suggest the government will once again cave to its scaremongering advisers and keep them in place. Lockdown measures are set to remain in place well into July despite the fact that 80% of Brits now have COVID-19 antibodies and the population reached herd immunity back in April. Earlier today, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, “Everyone can see very clearly is cases are going up and in some places hospitalisations are going up,” suggesting he is about to move the goalposts on his promises yet again. As we previously highlighted, the same scientists still advising Johnson admitted using “totalitarian” fear tactics, “mind control” and weaponizing behavioral psychology to terrify the public into total compliance. Deaths in England and Wales have been below the five-year average for 11 of the past 12 weeks. Given that 80% of adults now have COVID antibodies, what possible grounds could there be to delay the full reopening? https://t.co/97J2qNLeuS — Toby Young (@toadmeister) June 9, 2021 “Deaths in England and Wales have been below the five-year average for 11 of the past 12 weeks.

"German Study Finds Lockdown ‘Had No Effect’ on Stopping Spread of Coronavirus A major new study by German scientists at Munich University has found that lockdowns had no effect on reducing the country’s coronavirus infection rate. Oh. “Statisticians at Munich University found “no direct connection” between the German lockdown and falling infection rates in the country,” reports the Telegraph. The study found that, on all three occasions before Germany imposed its lockdowns in November, December and April, infection rates had already begun to fall. The R rate – the number that indicates how many other people an infected person passes the virus to – was already under 1 before the lockdown restrictions came into force. As we highlighted last year, a leaked study from inside the German Ministry of the Interior revealed that the impact of the country’s lockdown could end up killing more people than the coronavirus due to victims of other serious illnesses not receiving treatment. This is by no means the only study to have concluded that lockdowns are completely useless and don’t work. A peer reviewed study published in January by Stanford researchers found that mandatory lockdowns do not provide more benefits to stopping the spread of COVID-19 than voluntary measures such as social distancing. Back in March, Stanford medical professor Dr. Jay Bhattacharya told Newsweek that COVID-19 lockdowns are “the single worst public health mistake in the last 100 years.” Earlier this year, academics from Duke, Harvard, and Johns Hopkins concluded that there could be around a million excess deaths over the next two decades as a result of lockdowns. Other research has concluded lockdowns will conservatively “destroy at least seven times more years of human life” than they save. ——————————————————————————————————————— ALERT!

"Women falling behind in India’s COVID-19 vaccination drive Many more men in India have received COVID-19 vaccines than women, government data showed on Tuesday, highlighting gender disparity in the country’s immunisation drive that has also disadvantaged the rural population.India has partly or fully vaccinated about 101 million men, nearly 17% more than women. Men account for 54% of the total number of people inoculated, according to the data.Many federally administered regions, the capital Delhi, and big states such as Uttar Pradesh have seen some of the worst inequities. Only Kerala in the south and Chhattisgarh in central India have vaccinated more women than men.""We are noticing that men, especially in towns and villages, prefer to take the vaccine before women as they have to travel for work, while women are relegated to domestic chores,"" said Prashant Pandya, medical superintendent at a big government hospital in the western state of Gujarat.Health officials say rumours about vaccines disrupting women's menstruation cycle and reducing fertility have also contributed to the skewed data. The government has rejected the concerns.""The government will have to ramp up awareness programmes in rural India to ensure women understand the importance of vaccines and prioritise themselves in this race to secure the two shots,"" said Sudha Narayanan, a former bureaucrat who worked in the health ministry in New Delhi.Women will have to step forward to get vaccinated or the divide will rapidly widen, Narayanan added.1/2Monira Abbas Bhagasrala, 53, receives a dose of COVISHIELD, a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India, at a vaccination centre in Mumbai, India, May 6, 2021.

""The government must send the medicine to us.""India's vaccination policy has evolved fast but the federal government has so far resisted calls for door-to-door immunisations given that the vaccines have only been authorised for emergency use and recipients need to be monitored for a short period for any adverse reactions.Urban Indians are also getting COVID-19 shots much faster than the hundreds of millions of people living in the countryside, government data has shown. That is partly due to a policy that helped richer cities buy more vaccine doses than rural districts.  read more Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday reversed the policy and said vaccines will be offered at no charge to all adults starting June 21. The government will also facilitate more walk-in inoculations after complaints about the online registration process. read more India has so far administered 233.7 million doses, the most in the world after China and the United States, but given the necessary two doses to only about 5% of its estimated 950 million adults.India has the world’s second-largest number of coronavirus infections after the United States, with total cases at nearly 29 million, according to health ministry data.
