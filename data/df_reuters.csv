0,"Mexican rulers' lower house majority to shrink, results show","Mexicans pared back President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's power in elections on Sunday, an official projection based on early results showed, delivering his MORENA party and allies a reduced majority that will make sweeping change more difficult.The National Electoral Institute (INE) saw the ruling coalition winning between 265 and 292 of the 500 seats in the lower house, short of the two thirds majority needed to push through amendments to the constitution.The mid-term election was seen as a referendum on the president's policies and his shake-up of Mexico's institutions.The result, if confirmed, suggests voters want Lopez Obrador to tone down his plans to transform Mexico with an overhaul of politics and the economy. He has also toyed with constitutional changes to protect state energy companies.Since taking office in 2018 after a landslide victory, he has strengthened the role of the state in the energy sector and radically cut back on the cost of government to channel resources to the poor and his priority infrastructure projects.In the process, critics say, he has eroded institutional checks and balances and frequently criticized autonomous bodies, including the Bank of Mexico, prompting adversaries to sound the alarm about his concentration of power.The forecast outcome of the lower house election was in line with opinion polls late in the race, which showed Lopez Obrador's coalition losing some of its grip on the contest after a deadly metro accident in May and sexual abuse allegations against some of its most prominent candidates.Mexicans also chose 15 state governors and state lawmakers on Sunday. Results are still coming in. Opinion polls in recent days showed MORENA winning most of the 15 governors' races.'NOT HAPPY'The contest has taken place amid the COVID-19 pandemic and high levels of violent crime, with 91 politicians killed in this election cycle, according to security consultancy Etellekt.With security forces ramping up their presence in violence-plagued states Baja California, Guerrero, Michoacan and Sonora ahead of the election, crime was a top concern for many voters.In one incident on Sunday, a man threw a severed head at a voting station in the Terrazas del Valle neighborhood of the border city Tijuana as people voted. read more To stay on top in the long term, MORENA must improve its record on crime and the economy, officials, lawmakers and voters say. Mexico's economy contracted 8.5% in 2020, the most since the Great Depression of the 1930s, though it is now clawing back ground, lifted by U.S. demand. read more Olivia Aguirre, a 32-year-old academic in Mexico City who voted for Lopez Obrador in 2012 and 2018, said she was disillusioned with the president for his dismissal of women's protests against various problems including violence, a lack of support for renewable energy and what she called the ""authoritarian"" drift of his government.""I'm not happy about the direction the country is headed,"" she said after voting for the opposition in the city's Roma district.Many of her friends who had supported him felt the same way, though her parents still backed MORENA, she said. Early results pointed to setbacks in the capital for the ruling party.Even so, while voters have been critical of the government's record on job creation and fighting crime, skepticism of Mexico's former rulers, now in opposition, is marked. Lopez Obrador has also benefited from a coronavirus vaccine rollout.  read more The INE projections showed only moderate gains for the opposition coalition despite robust campaigning portraying Lopez Obrador as a danger to democracy.Voter Luis Dominguez, 36, in the small municipality of Cuaxomulco in the southeastern state of Tlaxcala said he was standing by the president.""We have to support him so he can complete his mission,"" said Dominguez.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

2,Thailand starts long awaited COVID-19 vaccination drive,"Thailand kicked off a long-awaited mass vaccination campaign on Monday as the country battles its third and worst wave of the coronavirus epidemic.The government aims to administer 6 million doses this month, hoping to ease worries over the highly anticipated roll-out and concerns about supply shortages.""The government will ensure that everyone is vaccinated,"" Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said in televised comments after he visited an inoculation centre in Bangkok.There were, however, early hiccups as some vaccine centres registered more than their quota, leading to postponements, senior health official Opas Karnkawinpong told a news conference.""We apologise if your vaccination appointment was postponed, but will make sure you are registered at the earliest,"" Opas said.Hospitals last week delayed vaccinations for nearly 40,000 people, citing a limited supply.  read more Thailand escaped the worst of the coronavirus pandemic as it hit other countries hard last year, but is now grappling with its deadliest outbreak. Officials have scrambled to source more vaccines amid the third wave, which so far accounts for more than 80% of its 179,886 total infections and 1,269 fatalities.Authorities on Monday said 235 cases of the B.1.617.2 variant, which ravaged India, had spread to nine provinces since it was first detected in Bangkok last month.The outbreaks has highlighted criticisms of the country's vaccine programme for an over-reliance on AstraZeneca shots produced by royal-owned Siam Bioscience, a slow roll-out and a confusing registration system.On Monday morning, 986 vaccination centres reported a total of 143,116 people received shots. That adds to 2.8 million people deemed vulnerable, including frontline health and transport workers.""My feeling is that no matter what, we will need to go outside of home for the littlest things, so getting the vaccine gives us a sense of relief,"" said Praepawee Lertpongkijja, 38, at a Bangkok vaccination centre.VACCINE SUPPLIESThe 6 million doses to be administered this month will be a mix of AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and imported Sinovac (SVA.O) vaccines.Concerns were raised last week over local production of the AstraZeneca vaccine by Siam Bioscience's after the Philippines said its order had been reduced and delayed.  read more The health ministry on Monday said it will receive an additional 3.42 million doses from AstraZeneca after mid-June said, did not specify how much would be locally made.It received 1.8 million locally-produced AstraZeneca shots on Friday.

""I even fainted near the school gate.""But Fatima said her resolve had grown since then and she was determined to return to school, even with the potential threat of another explosion.""I want to come back to school even more strongly than before and continue my studies,"" she said. ""I want to continue the path of those who were martyred.""Girls and boys at the high school study in three shifts. The May 8 attack targeted the second shift, which is for female students, Najiba Arian, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education, told Reuters.Fatima was in the school corridor getting ready to go home when the first bomb exploded outside the school gate.

But the minority Hazara neighbourhood where the school is located has repeatedly been targeted by militants.The United States and many other Western nations have touted girls' education as one of the key successes of years of foreign presence in Afghanistan.More than 3.5 million girls are now enrolled in school in the country, according to USAID, compared to none during the Taliban's rule from 1996 to 2001. But an estimated 3.7 million children remain out of school, 60% of them girls, according to UNICEF.Security is deteriorating as foreign forces prepare to leave Afghanistan later this year, emboldening some hard-line Islamist groups to threaten the progress made in girls' education.Fatima's father, 36-year-old Taqi Noori, said he thought about, but decided against, leaving the country.""There is always war in Afghanistan, but what can we do? This is our country ... if we go somewhere else, my children would be deprived of education,"" he said from their hillside home, about a 10-minute walk from Fatima's school.Fatima has continued her studies at home as she waits for the school to reopen, the timing of which remains uncertain.""I am interested in medical science, and I want to become a good doctor in the future to treat our security forces injured while defending our people, land, and our borders.""Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
4,Swiss to vote on whether to become first European nation to ban synthetic pesticides,"Switzerland could become the first European country to ban artificial pesticides in a June 13 referendum which backers of the initiative hope will trigger similar prohibitions elsewhere.Globally, only Bhutan has a complete ban on synthetic pesticides, according to supporters aiming to outlaw the use of products made by agro-chemical giants such as Switzerland's Syngenta and Germany's Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and BASF (BASFn.DE).Supporters of the ban say the artificial products cause serious health problems and reduce biodiversity. Manufacturers say their pesticides are rigorously tested and regulated, can be used safely and crop yields would slump without them.Another initiative to be voted on the same day aims to improve the quality of Switzerland's drinking water and food by stopping direct subsidies to farmers who use artificial pesticides and antibiotics in livestock.Switzerland has been starkly divided by an unusually bitter debate over the initiatives and the votes look set to be close. A recent Tamedia poll showed 48% of voters favoured the drinking water initiative and 49% supported the pesticide ban.If adopted, the proposals give farmers up to 10 years to make the transition, which would allow Switzerland to become a pioneer in organic food as well as an example to the rest of the world, Swiss wine maker Roland Lenz said.""Clean water, one of the foundations of life, is endangered,"" said Lenz, a 51-year-old organic farmer, whose vineyard is surrounded by farmers opposing the initiative.Syngenta, which is headquartered in Switzerland and owned by China National Chemical Corporation, opposes both initiatives, saying a ban would reduce agricultural yields by up to 40%.""The consequences of not using them are clear: fewer regional products, higher prices, and more imports. This is not in the interest of consumers, nor is it in the interest of the environment,"" a Syngenta spokesman said.LIFE UNDER SIEGEThe clean water initiative also wants farmers to stop using imported animal feed, to restrict the numbers of cows, pigs and chickens in Switzerland along with the manure they produce that can pollute drinking water.""People have been sold a romantic image of farming in Switzerland, which is far removed from reality,"" said Pascal Scheiwiller, a backer of the clean water campaign, which estimates 1 million Swiss people drink contaminated water.The Swiss Farmers Union said many of its members feel their way of life is under siege.""A lot of people in cities think if they have two tomatoes growing on the balcony of their apartment they understand farming,"" said Martin Haab, president of the Zurich Farmers Association.""I look back 200 years ago when we couldn't protect our plants and animals, and we had hunger in Switzerland and all over Europe,"" said Haab.Martin's son Dominic, who runs a dairy farm outside Zurich, said the consequences for the rural economy would be brutal, with local businesses also being hit by a fall in animal numbers to comply with the fodder restrictions.Wine maker Lenz, however, said to continue using pesticides was ""sheer lunacy"", especially when it was possible to use methods such as growing fruit with thicker skins to make them fungus resistant.“With a ‘Yes’ vote on both initiatives, we will finally move from the chemical age back to the organic age,” he said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
5,Analysis: India’s vaccine inequity worsens as countryside languishes,"Urban Indians are getting COVID-19 shots much faster than the hundreds of millions of people living in the countryside, government data shows, reflecting rising inequity in the nation’s immunisation drive.In 114 of India's least developed districts - collectively home to about 176 million people - authorities have administered just 23 million doses in total.That's the same number of doses as have been administered across nine major cities -- New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Thane and Nagpur -- which combined have half the population of the least developed districts.The disparity was even stronger last month, after the government allowed private sales of vaccines for adults aged under 45 years, an offer which favoured residents of cities with larger private hospital networks. For the first four weeks of May, those nine cities gave 16% more doses than the combined rural districts, data from the government’s Co-WIN vaccination portal shows.""My friends from the city were vaccinated at private hospitals,"" said Atul Pawar, a 38-year-old farmer from Satara, a rural western district of Maharashtra, India's wealthiest state. ""I am ready to pay, but doses are not available and district borders are sealed because of the lockdown.""The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said in a statement on Saturday that reports of vaccine inequity in India were ""inaccurate and speculative in nature"".""Liberalised pricing and accelerated national COVID-19 vaccination strategy ensures vaccine equity,"" it said, adding that smaller cities were also getting doses like the big ones.The ministry said it had asked states with fewer private hospitals to review the status of their vaccination campaigns and encourage some government-empanelled hospitals to strike deals with vaccine companies if need be.India has administered more than 222 million doses since starting its campaign in mid-January - only China and the United States have administered more - but it has given the required two doses to less than 5% of its 950 million adults.Rural India is home to more than two-thirds of the country's 1.35 billion people. While urban areas account for a disproportionately large share of the confirmed COVID-19 cases, those concerned about the spread of the virus in the countryside say statistics undercount cases in villages, where testing is less comprehensive.The health system in several regions in India collapsed in April and May as the country reported the world’s biggest jump in coronavirus infections, increasing pressure on the immunisation programme.1/2Suresh Kumar, 43, ties up the hair of his wife Pramila Devi, 36, who is suffering from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), before taking her to a local government dispensary, at their home in Kaljikhal, in the northern state of Uttarakhand, India, May 23, 2021./File PhotoRead MorePrime Minister Narendra Modi's government offers vaccines to vulnerable people, healthcare workers and those aged over 45 for free. Since last month, individual states have also been expected to procure vaccines for younger adults, or to provide them commercially through the private sector.Poorer states say this leaves their residents more vulnerable. The eastern state of Jharkhand, where nearly all districts are categorised as poor, this week urged Modi to give it free vaccines for all age groups.In many states the doses for those under 45 are available mostly or entirely in urban areas. Some officials say this is intentional, as the infection spreads more easily in crowded cities.""It's because of high-positivity"" in urban areas, said Bijay Kumar Mohapatra, health director of the eastern state of Odisha, explaining the state's decision to prioritise cities.Major international and domestic firms such as Microsoft (MSFT.O), Pepsi (PEP.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Reliance Industries (RELI.NS), Adani Group and Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) have organised inoculations for their employees, in many cases in partnership with private hospitals. Most of these companies and the huge private hospitals that serve them are located in urban centres.Vaccination rates in rural areas have also been depressed because of patchier internet access to use the complex online system for signing up for shots, and possibly because of greater hesitancy among villagers than among city dwellers.""LUCRATIVE DEALS""India's Supreme Court criticised the government's handling of the vaccination programme this week and ordered it to provide a breakdown of shots given in rural and urban areas.""Private hospitals are not equally spread out"" across the country and ""are often limited to bigger cities with large populations"", the top court said in its order dated May 31.""As such, a larger quantity will be available in such cities, as opposed to the rural areas,"" it said. Private hospitals may prefer to sell doses ""for lucrative deals directly to private corporations who wish to vaccinate their employees"".Dr. Rajib Dasgupta, head of the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said the risk of inequity was that parts of India would build up immunity disproportionately.“It can leave the rural population relatively more vulnerable.”Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
6,Meghan and Harry name baby daughter after Queen Elizabeth and Diana,"Meghan, Britain’s Duchess of Sussex, has given birth to her second child, a girl, whom she and husband Prince Harry have named after Queen Elizabeth and his late mother Princess Diana.Lilibet 'Lili' Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born on Friday at the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in California, with Harry in attendance. The couple's first child, Archie, was born in 2019.The choice of name pays tribute to the queen after a difficult year for the couple, and the wider royal family. Lilibet is a family nickname for the 95-year-old British monarch.Buckingham Palace said the queen, Harry’s father Prince Charles and his brother and wife, Prince William and Kate, were delighted with the news. Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined them in sending his congratulations.William and Kate said via their official Twitter account: ""We are all delighted by the happy news of the arrival of baby Lili. Congratulations to Harry, Meghan and Archie.""Meghan and Harry announced the birth with a statement.""On June 4th, we were blessed with the arrival of our daughter, Lili. She is more than we could have ever imagined, and we remain grateful for the love and prayers we've felt from across the globe,"" they said.""Thank you for your continued kindness and support during this very special time for our family.""Harry and Meghan said Lilibet's middle name was chosen to honour her grandmother, Princess Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997.Both mother and baby - who is eighth in line to the throne - were doing well and were back at home, their press secretary said.The nature of the announcement, almost two days after the birth, reflects the new life the couple have chosen in the United States.When William's wife Kate gave birth to her three children in recent years, she emerged each time alongside her husband from a London hospital just a few hours later to be photographed by the world's media that had camped out in the street.1/6Britain's Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, attend a roundtable discussion on gender equality at Windsor Castle, Windsor, Britain October 25, 2019. Jeremy Selwyn/Pool via ReutersRead MoreCRISISThe birth of Lilibet comes almost a year and a half after Harry and Meghan announced that they intended to step down from their royal roles, plunging the family into crisis.The situation deteriorated sharply in March this year when they gave an explosive interview to U.S. chat show host Oprah Winfrey, accusing one unnamed royal of making a racist remark and saying Meghan's pleas for help when she felt suicidal were ignored.The 39-year-old, whose mother is Black and father is white, said she had been naive before marrying into royalty.Harry, 36, and Meghan live in a secluded $14 million mansion in the celebrity enclave of Montecito, about 80 miles (130 km) north of Los Angeles, which is also home to Winfrey, comedian Ellen DeGeneres, and other celebrities.Harry's last major public appearance was at a VAX Live concert in Los Angeles on May 2. Meghan appeared by video at the concert, which aimed to boost vaccinations worldwide against the coronavirus.Meghan disclosed in a November 2020 essay that she suffered a miscarriage in July 2020.After the interview with Winfrey, Harry made further public criticism of his childhood, creating another public relations problem for the royal family which is led by the queen and 72-year-old Prince Charles.Just last month Harry spoke of the trauma of the loss of his mother and how that was compounded when he had to walk as a 12-year-old behind her coffin in a funeral cortege under the glare of the world's media.The queen, who lost her husband Prince Philip in April after 73 years of marriage, has said she was saddened to learn of the experiences of Harry and Meghan.The couple said they would be taking parental leave from their charity Archewell and have asked people who want to send gifts to support or learn about charities doing work for women and girls, the Archewell website said.The names given to the baby also echo those given to the only daughter of Prince William, Harry’s elder brother, who is called Charlotte Elizabeth Diana.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
7,Taxi for hire! Bangkok cabbie hopes to capitalise on his COVID-19 shot,"After losing countless fares during the pandemic, Thai taxi driver Sombat Subin has sought to reassure nervous clients by letting them know in three languages on the sign above his cab that he has been vaccinated against COVID-19.""I think the lit-up sign creates confidence for passengers and I feel that it has also helped increase my income,"" said Sombat, from Nonthaburi, a province north of Bangkok.The 43-year-old said the sign, which reads ""Vaccine"" and then ""COVID"" with a tick next to it and appears in Thai, English and Mandarin, was a conversation piece in his taxi.""It's to confirm to them that the driver has been fully vaccinated... So, the passengers are not afraid,"" he said.Sombat said he became a taxi driver three years ago after finding working in an office stifling. Before the pandemic, he earned about 60,000 baht ($1,920) a month, but this has slumped to as little as 10,000 baht during the latest wave of infections.Thailand had managed to largely contain virus cases for much of last year, but since April has struggled to quell its most serious outbreak so far that includes more contagious variants.This has increased pressure on authorities to speed up vaccinations with the country's rollout lagging many neighbours.Only 2.7 million Thais have received a first vaccine dose and the government has been scrambling to source more.Authorities have tried to prioritize frontline workers including taxi drivers and public transport staff.Kanokwan Sattawong, a passenger in Sombat's taxi, said: ""I feel more confident when drivers are fully vaccinated and feel safe to use public transportation.""Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
8,Pakistani train smashes into derailed carriages; 36 killed,"A train in Pakistan smashed into derailed carriages of another train on Monday, killing at least 36 people, government officials said, in the latest accident to highlight the perilous state of a more-than-165 year old railway system.The death toll was likely to rise as rescuers struggled to reach people trapped in several mangled compartments strewn across the tracks in the southern province of Sindh.A Pakistan Railways spokesman said at least 33 bodies had been taken to hospitals, among them two railway officials. More than 100 people were injured, he told Reuters.Police officer Umar Tufail said the toll rose to 36, and that his men could see four more bodies stuck in the wreckage.""We have not been able to take them out so far, but an operation is underway for that,"" he told reporters at the site. ""We have saved three more people; they are injured,"" he added.An injured passenger, who had been travelling on the train that derailed, recounted how one calamity led to another.""We felt as if we had been thrown away,"" the man, who had a bandaged head, told a television reporter from hospital, speaking of the initial derailing of his train.""The second train then hit our train that caused more damage,"" he said.The Pakistan Railways spokesman said several carriages of the first train fell across the adjacent track after the derailment in the Ghotki district.1/5Paramilitary soldiers and rescue workers gather at the site following a collision between two trains in Ghotki, Pakistan June 7, 2021. REUTERS/StringerRead MoreThe second train, coming from the other direction, then smashed into them, he added.""The driver tried to apply emergency brakes but the locomotive hit the infringing coaches,"" Pakistan Railways said in an initial report.""The track has got issues on several points, the coaches are old, some as old as 40 years,"" railway official Khalid Latif told Geo News TV.""I've told high-ups several times 'please do something about it',"" he said.Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Twitter he was shocked by the ""horrific"" accident and was ordering a comprehensive investigation into railway safety.Accidents on the decrepit system are common.In 2005, in the same district about 130 people were killed when a crowded passenger train rammed into another at a station and a third train hit the wreckage.Successive governments have been trying to secure funds to upgrade the system for years. Recently, Pakistani officials have been hoping China might help to finance work on the network as part of its Belt and Road Initiative of energy and infrastructure projects.“It’s very unfortunate,” Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said of the crash. “Our railway system has needed an overhaul for a long time.”Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

11,Mexican president vows focus on poor after mixed election results,"Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday vowed to double down on helping the poor after a mid-term election that clipped his wings in Congress with a reduced majority but handed a clutch of new state governments to his candidates.A preliminary estimate by the National Electoral Institute (INE) after Sunday's elections put Lopez Obrador's ruling coalition on course to win between 265 and 292 of the 500 lower-house seats, short of the two-thirds majority he managed to muster in the first half of his term.Since taking office in 2018, Lopez Obrador has redirected the federal budget to welfare programs and building infrastructure including a refinery and a train.Asked how he would respond to the outcome of the elections he said he was committed to doing more for the poor.""For me it's a source of pride that the humblest and poorest are the ones who most support the program of transformation,"" he said.Lopez Obrador thanked voters for ensuring his political project would still have a majority in the lower house, and with it, the control of the budget.However, the lower-house losses are likely to curb his scope to pursue constitutional changes to bolster his drive to tighten state control of the energy sector.The outcome was roughly in line with final opinion polls, which showed the race tightening after a fatal metro accident in Mexico City and accusations that Lopez Obrador had intervened excessively in the campaign.Investors saw the election as positive for Mexico's risk outlook. The peso gained as much as 1.1% to 19.7382 to the dollar to a three-week high. Lopez Obrador has attacked his predecessors as corrupt and in hock to corporate interests who fomented poverty, inequality and violence. But he has struggled to deliver on pledges to combat gang violence and lift anemic growth.Capitalizing on discontent over his record, the opposition made gains in Mexico City, provisional results showed.The capital has been a bastion for Lopez Obrador since he rose to national prominence as mayor from 2000 to 2005. The early results suggested MORENA had lost control of a number of the capital's 16 boroughs, which it previously dominated.""We need a government that's more open to what business is proposing,"" said Enrique Prendas, 56, a Mexico City resident who voted for Lopez Obrador in 2018 but this time switched his vote to the center-right National Action Party (PAN).However Lopez Obrador and allies may be on track to win 11 of 15 state government races, enlarging the party's footprint across the country.Lopez Obrador's leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) went into the vote with 253 seats in the lower house. According to INE projections, it will win between 190 and 203.The new lower house will be seated in September.MORENA and its allies won 42.5% of votes cast for the lower house, according to a preliminary count of 89% of ballots. The main opposition alliance was slightly behind on 40.0%.MORENA's individual tally was far ahead of its nearest rival, giving it a clear advantage in picking up seats from the 300 awarded under a first-past-the-post system. The remaining 200 house seats are divvied up via proportional representation.To defend its majority, MORENA will rely on votes from the Labor Party (PT) and the Green Party, a political grouping that has proven adept at forging alliances with whoever is in power.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
12,ASEAN ministers pressure Myanmar after 'painfully slow' progress,"Southeast Asian foreign ministers mediating on the crisis in Myanmar called on Monday for its military rulers to free prisoners and start an agreed political dialogue, expressing disappointment at ""very slow"" progress so far.The United Nations, Western countries and China back the effort by the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to find a way out of the crisis in Myanmar, a country paralysed by turmoil since a Feb. 1 coup that ended a decade of tentative democracy.Vivian Balakrishnan, foreign minister of Singapore, a key investor in Myanmar, said the ASEAN diplomatic effort ""only makes sense if there is a genuine desire within Myanmar itself for genuine dialogue and negotiations and reconciliation.""To be honest with you, we are disappointed at the slow – very, very slow progress,"" he told Singapore media in a call from Chongqing, China, where ASEAN foreign ministers met their Chinese counterpart on Monday.Myanmar's junta has shown little sign of heeding a consensus reached in April among the 10 ASEAN countries, including Myanmar, which calls for an end to violence, political talks and the naming of a regional special envoy.""Indonesia is really hoping that the implementation of the five points of consensus needs to be pushed after this meeting with, once again, a transparent process,"" Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi told a news conference.Malaysian Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said ASEAN must admit that progress on the consensus was ""painfully slow"".""The int'l (international) community is awaiting ASEAN's further action,"" he said on Twitter.In a summary of remarks read at the meeting, he said ASEAN ""must act more quickly to reduce tensions and stop violence"".The junta has struggled to impose control since ousting elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, which triggered a wave of anger, protests and strikes, and efforts to build a nationwide alliance to thwart the military's bid to consolidate power.TRIAL LOOMSNobel laureate Suu Kyi, 75, will go on trial next week in the first of several criminal cases against her, according to her lawyer, who met her on Monday for a court hearing.The charges include illegal possession of two-way radios, breaking coronavirus protocols, and bribery.The trial must be concluded by July 26, chief lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told Reuters, citing the presiding judge. Suu Kyi has been held at an undisclosed location.  read more She is charged separately with violating the Official Secrets Act, punishable by 14 years in jail.The ASEAN ministers' comments follow a visit to Myanmar on Friday by two ASEAN envoys during which they urged the junta to free all detainees and discussed implementing the consensus.The envoys met military chief Min Aung Hlaing and several junta-appointed ministers, in a visit ASEAN did not announce.Unlike his more reclusive predecessors, Min Aung Hlaing has sought to maintain a high public profile since the coup.

13,Peru's Castillo says there is 'hope' as razor-thin margin keeps country on edge,"Socialist presidential candidate Pedro Castillo said Peruvians are a ""people of hope"" on Sunday, with the country on edge as unofficial vote counts showed him and his conservative election rival separated by the thinnest of margins.A quick count of votes cast in Sunday's election, with a 1% error margin by Ipsos Peru, put Castillo, an elementary school teacher and novice politician, ahead by 0.4 of a percentage point.A previous Ipsos exit poll, with a 3% error margin, put his rival in the run-off election, Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of jailed ex-President Alberto Fujimori, up by 0.6 of a percentage point.By 1 a.m. (0600 GMT), the ONPE electoral agency had published partial official results with 61% of votes counted that put Fujimori first with 52.4% of votes and Castillo second with 47.5%. Authorities however cautioned that this count was predominantly urban, where the conservative candidate has an advantage.""We need to have faith in the people,"" Castillo said. ""Our votes still remain to be counted, the votes of the provinces.""The quick-count results triggered celebrations and cries of ""we won"" from Castillo's supporters in Tacabamba, the Andean town closest to the impoverished village where he was born and raised, which is also where he is waiting for the results.Hundreds gathered in Tacabamba's main square before midnight for a concert with a pro-Castillo presenter telling the crowd: ""yes we can"". The concert appeared to violate an 11 p.m. curfew linked to the coronavirus, which has hit Peru particularly hard.A tight race could lead to days of uncertainty as counts trickle in, and could trigger unrest if disillusioned supporters of either candidate question the results.Castillo had earlier called his supporters onto the streets after an exit poll gave a slender lead to Fujimori. But he has not made any official comment since the quick count put him as the likely winner, and neither has Fujimori.""I ask our people to defend every vote,"" Castillo wrote on Twitter when the early forecast suggested he would lose. ""I call on Peruvian people from all corners of the country to go to the streets in peace to be vigilant in the defence of democracy.""Speaking before the quick count via megaphone from a balcony to crowds in Tacabamba, Castillo appealed for calm.""We must be prudent, the people are wise,"" said the 51-year-old schoolteacher who has vowed to redistribute wealth and rewrite the constitution. ""What we have heard is not official.""Fujimori said she was reserving judgement until the official results. She also appealed for ""prudence, calm and peace from both groups, those who voted and did not vote for us.""CROWDS GATHERReuters witnesses reported a small crowd of people gathering outside the headquarters of Castillo's Peru Libre party in the capital, Lima.Opinion polls up to election day had indicated a statistical dead heat, with Fujimori, who had earlier trailed Castillo, pulling slightly ahead at the end of campaigning.  read more Polls showed urban and higher-income citizens prefer Fujimori, while the rural poor largely support Castillo.Both candidates have pledged vastly different remedies for rescuing Peru from the economic doldrums brought on by the COVID-19 crisis, which has seen it lead the world in per capital deaths.Fujimori, a 46-year-old who has tilted at the presidency twice before, has pledged to follow the free-market model and maintain economic stability in the world’s second-largest copper producer.Castillo, the son of peasant farmers, has promised to redraft the constitution to strengthen the role of the state, take a larger portion of profits from mining firms and nationalize key industries.Voting in the Lima district of Surco on Sunday afternoon, Fujimori noted a handful of allegations of doctored voting papers discovered in the capital and the country´s interior.""We know that there have been incidents today. We hope that the electoral bodies will take action on the matter and sanctions will be issued accordingly,"" she said. ""I also expect our party officials to be on their guard.""In Lima, voters made their way to polling stations by bike, roller skates and on foot to traffic jams that built up as the day progressed.Among those casting their vote in Lima was Luis Pizango, who said that for him, ""transparency"" was key.""May Peru win for the good of all Peruvians,"" he said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
14,Hungary appears to back-pedal on Chinese university plans after protests,"Hungary appeared to backtrack on plans to build a Chinese university in the capital Budapest after thousands took to the streets at the weekend accusing the government of cosying up to Beijing, provoking an angry Chinese response.Opponents of nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban fear the planned $2 billion campus could undercut the quality of higher education and help Beijing increase its influence in Hungary and the European Union.  read more A senior Orban aide said late on Sunday the university was not even at the planning phase, and once the plan took shape, in early 2023, it could be put to a referendum.""Once the project's conditions are known, we support a referendum in Budapest to decide whether locals want Fudan University here,"" Gergely Gulyas, Orban's chief of staff, told the pro-government news web site Mandiner late on Sunday.Orban, a self-styled illiberal, has built cordial ties with China, including massive joint business projects, and has several times this year blocked EU statements denouncing China's record on human rights, angering his allies.  read more According to media reports, the government was willing to pay for the construction of Shanghai-based Fudan University's first campus in Europe with a Chinese loan. The campus would displace a planned local student housing area.Public support for the campus is low, according to an opinion survey conducted last month, and Orban's ruling Fidesz party has weak support in Budapest, so a referendum could turn out against the project.Orban and Fidesz face their first competitive elections next year after three successive landslides since 2010. Opposition parties have united against Fidesz for the first time and caught up with them in polls.Political observers say Orban could decide to bide his time on Fudan and return to the idea after the election.""It is hallmark Fidesz to take two steps back to wait until the issue loses political steam, then attempt it again when it is more convenient politically,"" Political Capital analyst Peter Kreko said.Orban has abandoned unpopular projects before, such as a tax on internet traffic, a separate administrative court system and  plans to privatise marinas at Lake Balaton.OPPOSITION SPARS WITH CHINAGergely Karacsony, the opposition mayor of Budapest and a top contender to challenge Orban in elections next year, said on Saturday the university protest was a symbol of Hungarians rejecting heavy-handed government decisions.""Although we are worlds apart on human rights... we really just don't want a Chinese elite school built at the expense of Hungarian taxpayers,"" Karacsony told Saturday's rally.A media spokesman at the Chinese Embassy in Hungary, who did not give his name, criticised Karacsony's comments on the embassy's Facebook page.""In broad daylight, it is unseemly to criticize the internal affairs of another country, especially when I heard some key words in his speech, such as 'Tiananmen Square protests', 'democracy', 'human rights' and 'values',"" the official said.The Chinese embassy said it would address Reuters questions on a planned Fudan referendum at a later stage.Hungary blocked an EU statement in April criticising China's new security law in Hong Kong, undermining the bloc's efforts to confront Beijing's curbing of freedoms in the former British colony.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

16,Hundreds of former leaders urge G7 to vaccinate poor against COVID-19,"One hundred former presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers have urged the Group of Seven (G7) rich nations to pay for global coronavirus vaccinations to help stop the virus mutating and returning as a worldwide threat.The leaders made their appeal ahead of a G7 summit in England which begins on Friday, when U.S. President Joe Biden will meet the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. In their letter to the G7, the former world leaders said global cooperation had failed in 2020, but that 2021 could usher in a new era.""Support from the G7 and G20 that makes vaccines readily accessible to low- and middle-income countries is not an act of charity, but rather is in every country's strategic interest,"" the letter said.Among the signatories were ex-British premiers Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, former U.N. Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon and 15 former African leaders.They said the G7 and other leaders invited to the summit should guarantee to pay what would amount to about $30 billion a year over two years towards fighting the pandemic worldwide.""For the G7 to pay is not charity, it is self-protection to stop the disease spreading, mutating and returning to threaten all of us,"" Brown said.""Costing just 30 pence ($0.43) per person per week in the UK, is a small price to pay a for the best insurance policy in the world,"" he added in a statement.Their plea coincided with a poll by the Save the Children charity which found strong public support in the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Canada for the G7 paying towards the $66 billion needed for COVID-19 vaccines globally.In Britain, 79% were in favour of such a policy, while 79% of Americans backed the proposal, the poll showed.

17,Australia's Victoria logs biggest rise in COVID-19 cases in a week,"Australia's Victoria state on Monday reported its biggest rise in new locally acquired COVID-19 cases in nearly a week as authorities scramble to track the source of the highly infectious Delta variant found among infections.Authorities reported 11 new cases, up from just two a day earlier, but noted that all were linked to existing clusters, as residents of state capital Melbourne wait to hear if an extended snap lockdown will end as planned on Thursday night.""Nothing is on or off the table,"" Victoria state Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton told reporters in Melbourne, when asked if some areas of the city could remain locked down while other areas start to ease curbs.Melbourne entered its 11th day of a hard lockdown on Monday after officials on Friday found the Delta virus variant, which they said was likely to spread more easily than many other strains, for the first time among infections.The source for the Delta variant infections has yet to be identified and there has been no genomic match so far with any other cases in Australia.The new case numbers take the total number of locally acquired cases in the latest outbreak in Victoria, the country's second-most populous state, to 83.An empty Queen Victoria Market is seen on the first day of a seven-day lockdown as the state of Victoria looks to curb the spread of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Melbourne, Australia, May 28, 2021.  REUTERS/Sandra SandersMonday's data includes two cases announced on Sunday which were recorded after the midnight cut-off deadline.All of Monday's locally acquired cases are linked to existing clusters, officials said, with eight being close contacts who were isolating while infectious.The Delta variant, which has been classified by the World Health Organization as among the four COVID-19 variants of concern due to evidence that it spreads more easily, likely caused the latest devastating outbreak in India.Australia has largely reined in prior outbreaks with snap lockdowns, regional border restrictions and tough social distancing rules keeping COVID-19 numbers relatively low with just over 30,150 cases and 910 deaths.About 20% of Australia's adult population has received a first vaccine dose, with more than 5 million total shots administered so far.Victoria endured a hard lockdown for nearly three months last year to suppress a second wave of COVID-19 that killed more than 800 people, about 90% of all coronavirus deaths in Australia since the pandemic began.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

20,Carbon dioxide in the air at highest level since measurements began,"Despite a massive reduction in commuting and in many commercial activities during the early months of the pandemic, the amount of carbon in Earth's atmosphere in May reached its highest level in modern history, a global indicator released on Monday showed.Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, said the findings, based on the amount of carbon dioxide in the air at NOAA's weather station on Mauna Loa in Hawaii, was the highest since measurements began 63 years ago.The measurement, called the Keeling Curve after Charles David Keeling, the scientist who began tracking carbon dioxide there in 1958, is a global benchmark for atmospheric carbon levels.Instruments perched on NOAA's mountaintop observatory recorded carbon dioxide at about 419 parts per million last month, more than the 417 parts per million in May 2020.Because carbon dioxide is a key driver of climate change, the findings show that reducing the use of fossil fuels, deforestation and other practices that lead to carbon emissions must be a top priority to avoid catastrophic consequences, Pieter Tans, a scientist with NOAA's Global Monitoring Laboratory, said in a report on the emissions.“We are adding roughly 40 billion metric tons of CO2 pollution to the atmosphere per year,” Tans wrote. “That is a mountain of carbon that we dig up out of the Earth, burn, and release into the atmosphere as CO2 - year after year.""The amount of carbon in the air now is as much as it was about 4 million years ago, a time when sea level was 78 feet (24 meters) higher than it is today and the average temperature was 7 degrees Fahrenheit higher than it was before the Industrial Revolution, the report said.Despite the pandemic lockdown, scientists were not able to see a drop in the overall amount of carbon in the atmosphere  partly because of wildfires, which also release carbon, as well as the natural behavior of carbon in the atmosphere, the report said.The carbon dioxide levels measured were not affected by the eruption of Hawaiian volcanoes, Tans said, adding the station is situated far enough from active volcanoes that measurements are not distorted, and occasional plumes of carbon dioxide are removed from the data.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
21,Kremlin critic Dmitry Gudkov says his Russia exit is a tactical retreat,"Russian opposition politician Dmitry Gudkov said on Monday his decision to leave Russia was a temporary and tactical retreat because he could no longer practice politics effectively due to unprecedented pressure from the authorities.Gudkov, who was held in custody for two days last week in a case he said was fabricated, said on Sunday he had left Russia  after receiving warnings from people close to the Kremlin that he would be arrested if he remained in the country. Gudkov, who sat in Russia's lower house of parliament until 2016, had hoped to run for a seat again in September but said the pressure on him and his family from the authorities had made it impossible to pursue politics inside Russia for now.""I want to return to Russia. This is some sort of a temporary retreat, to gather up strength and move on... into the battle,"" he told Reuters in an interview after his arrival in Kyiv.""If I did not leave, they would have started repression against me and my whole family. They gave me very little time,"" he said.""I thought I am not ready to sacrifice the lives and health of my relatives and friends, and allies for the sake of some hypothetical rise to power in 2024,"" he said, referring to the  next Russian presidential election.The Kremlin says that legal cases against Gudkov and other opposition figures ahead of this year's parliamentary election  are not connected to politics.A number of activists critical of the Kremlin have been put under house arrest, fled the country or been jailed on charges they say are politically motivated. He has accused the Kremlin of cracking down on the opposition to make it impossible for independent candidates to run in this year’s parliamentary election. The Kremlin has denied trying to clear the field of political opponents.Gudkov told Ukrainian television on Monday that he would join his parents in Bulgaria after completing previously scheduled engagements in Kyiv.Gudkov's father Gennady is a former politician and Kremlin critic who relocated to the Bulgarian port city of Varna in 2019 as a precaution.Gudkov said he wanted to return to Russia but could not say when. “It is indeed unprecedented pressure,” he told Reuters.    “It is not clear how the situation will develop after the election, from which almost all the prominent critics of the regime have been barred.”Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
22,EU veto ‘hostage’-taking on foreign policy must end -Germany’s Maas,"Germany’s foreign minister said on Monday the European Union should abolish the right of individual member states to veto foreign policy measures as the 27-nation bloc could not allow itself to be “held hostage”.His comments, which came days after a more junior official criticised Hungary by name, reflect growing frustration in Berlin at the way in which EU member countries can prevent it from acting in matters on which almost all members agree.""We can't let ourselves be held hostage by the people who hobble European foreign policy with their vetoes,"" Heiko Maas told a conference of Germany's ambassadors in Berlin.""If you do that then sooner or later you are risking the cohesion of Europe. The veto has to go, even if that means we can be outvoted.""His remarks amount to a highly unusual rebuke by Germany of a fellow member state. Germany, conscious of its economic and political heft within the EU, is normally very cautious about being seen to throw its weight for fear of seeming overbearing.Hungary blocked an EU statement in April criticising China’s new security law in Hong Kong, undermining EU efforts to confront Beijing’s restrictions of freedoms in the former British colony. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday that the European left, led by the German left, was attacking Hungary because of ""its refusal to sign a politically inconsequential and frivolous joint declaration on Hong Kong"".These declarations make the EU look like a ""pathetic paper tiger,"" Orban wrote on his official website.""There must be an end to the preoccupation in Brussels with concocting and flaunting declarations. ... In recent years this common foreign policy approach, motivated by domestic political considerations, has led to the European Union's foreign policy stance becoming a laughing stock,"" Orban said.He said the EU's foreign policy should be decided by heads of states and governments instead of what he called bureacrats, citing the latest meeting of the European Council regarding Russia as a positive example.""As far as Europe's policy on China is concerned, we believe that we must prevent the reemergence of Cold War policies and culture in world politics,"" the nationalist premier added.Last month, Budapest refused to ratify a new EU trade and development accord with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and also declined to support an EU call for a ceasefire in violence between Israel and the Palestinians.Under Orban, Hungary has pursued closer ties with China, most recently agreeing to host a foreign campus of a Chinese university in Budapest over a chorus of opposition protest.

From Tuesday the judges will begin summarising the evidence gathered by investigators in the case, and potentially calling witnesses.Judge Hendrik Steenhuis said his panel would be looking specifically to determine what type of missile hit the airplane, where it was fired from and whether the four suspects can be held responsible.""It is taking a long time but we want to know the truth. It is the only thing we can still do for the children,"" said Rob Frederiksz, whose 23-year-old son Bryce died along with his girlfriend Daisy in the crash.After years of collecting evidence, a team of international investigators concluded in May 2018 that the missile launcher used to shoot down the aircraft belonged to Russia's 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade. The Dutch government holds Moscow responsible. Russia denies any involvement.On Monday the Kremlin said it was following the trial and took note of ""alternative information"" that could lead to other explanations of the crash from the Dutch prosecutor's main theory of the Russian-made missile fired by pro-Russian separatists.""But again, because we are not part of the investigation, we cannot directly influence what is happening,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Washington has criticized the removal of a senior judge from Guatemala's top court, in what Giammattei has argued was a legitimate process.The corruption task force has been previously floated, but Harris gave more details, saying it will combine resources from the Justice, State and Treasury departments.Giammattei defended his own record in fighting corruption, saying he had not been accused of wrongdoing and saying graft was not only a problem faced by politicians. The fight against drug trafficking needed to be an integral part of tackling corruption, he said.On the immigration front he announced a new processing center for migrants sent back from Mexico and the United States, which could increase capacity. He said the focus of the two countries should be on creating prosperity.Most Guatemalan migrants leave because of poverty, he said, and come from a few rural municipalities.

27,"Once a lock for ruling party, opposition make electoral gains in Mexican capital","Mexico's sprawling capital has long been a bedrock of support for President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, dating back to his term as mayor years ago, but city voters shifted on Sunday, giving opponents a string of major wins, according to preliminary results.The congressional election in the country looked likely to give Lopez Obrador's allies a majority, albeit slimmed down. In Mexico City, though, his party did not fare so well in elections for borough leaders.While his leftist National Regeneration Movement, known as MORENA, held on to Mexico City's most populous boroughs, including Iztapalapa and Gustavo Madero, it lost nine of the capital's 16 districts.Lopez Obrador blamed the opposition gains on unfriendly press coverage.""You have to keep in mind that this is where there were more attacks from the media,"" said Lopez Obrador, speaking at his regular morning news conference at the national palace in downtown Mexico City.The leftist leader often lashes out at the media, which he derides as mostly elitist and overly concentrated in the capital.More outreach was needed, he said on Monday.Lopez Obrador built up his power base in the capital when he served as mayor from 2000 to 2005, and MORENA took all but four of the boroughs when Lopez Obrador swept to power three years ago in a landslide election victory.But the opposition was able to capitalize on discontent over his record since he became president.

Do not come. The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our borders,"" Harris said at a news conference alongside Giammattei. ""If you come to our border, you will be turned back.""Harris also said a U.S. anti-corruption task force would work with local prosecutors to punish corrupt actors in the region.The Biden administration has identified corruption as an underlying cause of the poverty and violence driving record numbers of Central Americans to go to the United States.The corruption task force has been previously floated, but Harris gave more details, saying it will combine resources from the Justice, State and Treasury departments.In the build-up to Harris' visit to Guatemala, her first official overseas trip, differences of opinion emerged about the fight against graft, with corruption fighters feted by Washington being criticized by Giammattei.""We had a robust, candid and thorough conversation,"" Harris said at the news conference after a three-hour meeting with Giammattei, who said they had discussed U.S. concerns about developments in Guatemala.""The president and I discussed the importance of anti-corruption and the importance of an independent judiciary,"" Harris said. Washington has criticized the removal of a senior judge from Guatemala's top court, in what Giammattei has argued was a legitimate process.Giammattei defended his own record in fighting malfeasance, saying he had not been accused of wrongdoing and saying graft was not only a problem faced by politicians. The fight against drug trafficking needed to be an integral part of tackling corruption, he said.On the immigration front he announced a new processing center for migrants sent back from Mexico and the United States, which could increase capacity.

She said the United States has contributed to regime change and destabilization in Latin America for decades. ""We can't help set someone's house on fire and then blame them for fleeing.""The United States orchestrated a coup against democratically elected leftist government Jacobo Arbenz in 1954, ushering in decades of military governments and a civil war estimated to have killed more than 200,000 people by the time it ended in 1996.More recently, the U.S.-financed, U.N. Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala helped bring down democratically elected conservative President Otto Perez Molina, a former general, who resigned after massive protests triggered by an investigation into corruption in his government.The Biden administration on Monday also unveiled details of another task force of prosecutors to combat human smuggling in Central America and Mexico.U.S. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said the Joint Task Force Alpha would marshal Justice Department and Homeland Security resources against ""the most prolific and dangerous"" human smuggling and trafficking groups in the region, according to a statement. It said the group will complement efforts against corrupt actors.However, Washington's push to tackle ""root causes"" of migration in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras have been undermined by a backlash against anti-corruption bodies the United States considers independent but that local elites say are biased.Harris also met civil society leaders and entrepreneurs in Guatemala. The White House announced a $7.5 million commitment through USAID to support entrepreneurs in Guatemala, as well as millions more in investments in affordable housing, agri-businesses and loans to small businesses.Harris said she discussed sharing COVID-19 vaccines with Guatemala during Monday’s meeting.

Taiwan. So we need to stand up for the rules-based national order,"" he said.On Russia, Stoltenberg said, ""we agree on the dual-track approach, meaning deterrence, defense and dialogue with Russia.""Sullivan said Biden will stress the importance of NATO countries' burden-sharing and the need for allies to contribute to alliance exercises and operations. He added that the United States will respond if Russia's ""harmful"" activities against Washington continue.Sullivan said Biden spoke with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday and reassured him that he would defend Ukraine's sovereignty in his talks with Putin.According to Sullivan, he also said he hoped the G7 nations would come up with an ""action plan"" to increase their collective defenses against ransomware attacks and deal with the challenges posed by cryptocurrency, which, he said, ""lies at the core of how these ransom transactions are played out.""On the sidelines of a NATO summit in Brussels on June 14, Biden is also expected to meet with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, a crucial session between the sparring NATO allies after Ankara's purchase of Russian defense systems angered Washington and risked driving a wedge within the alliance.Sullivan said the talks with Erdogan would be expansive, covering the eastern Mediterranean, Syria and Afghanistan as well as how to deal with the differences that have arisen between the two countries.He said that Biden and Erdogan, who have known each other for many years now, were looking forward to having a ""business-like"" opportunity to have a broad review of bilateral ties.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Armed groups increasingly outgun Haiti's security forces and fight with one another over territory.The United Nations said on Sunday it was ""profoundly worried"" about the impact of the growing violence on civilians, recalling similar incidents over the past year that forced thousands to flee.Haiti is also facing a surge in COVID-19 cases and is bracing for a referendum at the end of June over a new constitution.Attackers raided six police stations over the weekend, killing three police officers and burning their bodies in one attack, local news outlets reported. In another, a police inspector who refused to hand over weapons was shot to death.The head of the national police, Leon Charles, confirmed two of the attacks and the inspector's death, telling a news conference on Sunday that authorities were intensifying efforts to combat the gangs.He said police had restored control of a highway leading south from the capital that had been blocked by gang warfare around the troubled neighborhood of Martissant since last Wednesday.The latest flare-up appeared to have killed about 10 people - including civilians - and forced thousands to flee the area as assailants torched homes and businesses, the office of civil protection said in a statement.Videos on social media last week showed bodies along the empty highway that was manned by gunmen. The videos also showed displaced people, including children, taking refuge in a church, in a market square and at a sports center.Fresh produce ran low in Port-au-Prince as trucks carrying supplies from the south were blocked.""The phenomenon of gangsterization is taking on more and more alarming proportions,"" the office of civil protection said, adding there were conflicts in at least three other neighborhoods of the capital.

41,Women score historic wins in Mexico’s mid-term elections,"Women were poised to win a record number of state governors’ offices in Mexican mid-term elections on Sunday, capturing territory long dominated by men and giving them a bigger political platform to reach the presidency one day.Preliminary tallies by electoral authorities on Monday showed female candidates securing six of the 15 regional bastions on offer, just two shy of the total number of women ever elected to lead regional governments in Mexico's history.Five of the six went to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), which dominated the state votes, even as the leftist party’s hold on the lower house of Congress weakened. If results are confirmed, it means the northern border states of Baja California and Chihuahua, Guerrero and Colima on the Pacific coast, as well as Tlaxcala in the center and Campeche in the south, will be governed by women.""This is a cultural shift,"" said MORENA lawmaker Gabriela Cuevas, the first Mexican to head the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a global body of national parliaments. ""And definitely a step forward for women in our country and in political life.""Only eight women had previously won regional elections, including the current mayor of Mexico City, MORENA's Claudia Sheinbaum, who is regarded as one of the favorites to succeed Lopez Obrador as president.Since Griselda Alvarez was chosen to run Colima in 1979 - a few weeks after Margaret Thatcher made history as Britain's first woman Prime Minister - Mexico's handful of female governors very rarely overlapped with other women in the job.Now seven out of the 32 regional governments, including Mexico City, will be run by women simultaneously.That is likely to create space for a different kind of politics where women's concerns gain in prominence, said Francisco Abundis, head of Mexican polling firm Parametria.That was especially true as three of the new governors are under 40 and may have long careers ahead of them, he noted.VOTER STRENGTHThe latest national census showed there are roughly 3 million more women than men among Mexico's population of 126 million, and political leaders are increasingly at pains to ensure equal representation in government.Lopez Obrador made history in 2018 by appointing a cabinet split evenly between men and women, though he has come under fire from women's groups for failing to take seriously enough issues like domestic violence and abortion rights.Many women were angry about Lopez Obrador's support for MORENA's original candidate for Guerrero, Felix Salgado, whose campaign was dogged by rape accusations.Salgado denied the allegations but was eventually forced out of the race by electoral authorities for campaign finance irregularities. He was replaced by his daughter Evelyn, who won Guerrero on Sunday night, the results showed.Some Mexicans argue that male domination is still too deeply entrenched in the country for a female president to be realistic as soon as 2024, when the next election is due.""Because of the macho mentality,"" argued Gypsy Lara, a 29-year-old business owner in Mexico City who said she would be happy to back Sheinbaum for president.Sheinbaum, whose popularity took a hit last month over a metro accident that killed 26 people, had a tough night on Sunday with MORENA suffering shock losses in city elections.Despite the setbacks, the 58-year-old is still one of the strongest candidates for the presidency, said Abundis.""I think (female candidates) will be one of the cards to play in 2024,"" he said. ""With everything we're seeing in terms of gender-based movements in the country and the world, in Mexico it's more of a contrast with the whole macho tradition.""Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

It’s 100 per cent impossible to have an Olympics with zero risk...of the spread of infection in Japan and also in other countries after the Olympics,"" the Times quoted Oshitani as telling the newspaper.""There are a number of countries that do not have many cases, and a number that don’t have any variants. We should not make the Olympics (an occasion) to spread the virus to these countries,"" he added, noting most countries lack vaccines.Already postponed from last year because of the pandemic, a scaled-down version of the Games with no foreign spectators is set to start on July 23 despite public fears the event could spread the coronavirus and drain medical resources.However, a former Olympian turned public health expert said she believed the Games can be pulled off with an acceptable level of risk.""There will be cases, but having one case or a couple of cases doesn't mean that it was a failure,"" Tara Kirk Sell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Reuters on Tuesday.PRAYING FOR PANDEMIC RELIEFPlaybooks from event organisers detailing testing regimes and movement restrictions for athletes and other visitors ""outline a good strategy"" for minimising contagion, Sell added.Media arriving from abroad to cover the Games will be closely monitored to ensure they don't leave pre-registered areas such as hotels and sports venues, Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto said. She also said Japan's Olympics-related staff were expected to start getting vaccinated in mid-June.  read more ""... we are still in a very difficult situation, but we have seen a gradual decrease of infections in Tokyo, and I am praying that the pandemic is brought under control as swiftly as possible,"" Hashimoto said at the start of a Tokyo 2020 board meeting.Japan has been spared the explosive outbreaks seen elsewhere but has recorded over 760,000 cases and more than 13,600 deaths. Tokyo and other regions are under a state of emergency as the nation battles a fourth wave which is straining hospitals.The government's top medical adviser, Shigeru Omi, said last week medical experts planned a statement on the Games by June 20, when the state of emergency is set to be lifted.A labour union in the northern island of Hokkaido, where the Olympic marathon will be held, petitioned its governor on Monday calling for the Games to be cancelled, media said.Japanese Olympic Committee board member Kaori Yamaguchi, a judo bronze medallist at the 1988 Games, said on Friday Japan  had been ""cornered"" into pressing ahead with the Games.  read more Japan's public remains divided about holding the Games, although opposition appears to be easing somewhat.

More than 3,500 people have died and 700,000 have been displaced in the violence.Announcing the visa sanctions, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States was deeply concerned by the continued insecurity and called for both sides to negotiate for peace.""This decision reflects our commitment to advance a dialogue to peacefully resolve the Anglophone crisis and support respect for human rights,"" he said in a statement.He did not say which individuals might be affected by the visa restrictions.Rights groups accuse both sides of committing atrocities. While the government typically dismisses these accusations, it has, in a few cases, subsequently arrested soldiers and accused them of being involved in killings and torture.

50,How China's vaccine diplomacy brought bosom buddy Cambodia even closer,"Almost one in every five Cambodians has already received a dose of anti-coronavirus vaccine, catapulting the country well past wealthier, bigger Southeast Asian neighbours. Like the doses, the success story is labelled 'Made in China'.Already one of China's closest allies, Cambodia kickstarted inoculations with a bigger donation of vaccines from China than any other country in the region - in addition to Chinese vaccines it had already bought itself.Cambodia's early progress reflects Beijing's vaccine diplomacy in a region where competition with U.S. influence is intense, but has increased concerns among some Cambodians over the closeness of those ties. The United States announced its first major donations to Asia last week.""The question is asked whether Cambodia is too dependent on China,"" authoritarian Prime Minister Hun Sen said in a recent speech. ""If I don't rely on China, whom should I rely on? Without the donations and sales of vaccines from China, we would not have vaccinated the Cambodian people.""Only the wealthy city state of Singapore has made more rapid progress in Southeast Asia relative to population.Some 16% of Cambodia's 16 million people have had at least one vaccine dose, according to official numbers. Close behind are tiny Brunei and then Laos, another state with very close links to Beijing.Much bigger Malaysia and Indonesia had only managed 7.6% and 6.6% respectively, with Thailand on 4.6% and the Philippines 4.2%, according to the latest official data.In Vietnam, where anti-China feeling runs strong, little more than 1% of the population had been covered. Hanoi only approved a Chinese vaccine for emergency use on June 4.""The Cambodian vaccination campaign depends on the use of Chinese vaccines, the road that Hanoi is not willing to take,"" said Nguyen Khac Giang, a PhD candidate at Victoria University of Wellington.'HOLDING HANDS'As Cambodia faced its worst surge of the virus last month, China pledged full support ""which not only embodies the two sides' special friendship but China's responsibility for the China-Cambodia community of a shared future"", China's Global Times quoted foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian as saying.Over 90% of the vaccines Cambodia has used so far are Chinese - from donations totalling 1.7 million doses as of late April, and purchases of 4 million doses from Chinese drugmaker Sinovac. The only other vaccines used have been from the global COVAX programme, set up to assist inoculation in less wealthy countries.""China is the first country to give aid to Cambodia, they let Cambodians get vaccinated and the quality is good,"" said 19-year-old Sinopharm-vaccinated waiter Song Sok Putheara.But he added: ""They help us too much and too often, like they are holding hands and not letting us go.""Still, China's ties with Cambodia have suited both governments.China stepped up aid and investment even as Hun Sen was condemned by Western countries for alleged human rights abuses and the crushing of his political opposition.Meanwhile Cambodia has backed China's position on its extensive claims in the South China Sea against Southeast Asian rivals. It also has growing defence ties - while denying U.S. accusations it is becoming a forward base for China's People's Liberation Army.""Vaccines have become an act of political diplomacy to make and increase Chinese influence in the region, in the world and in Cambodia,"" said Pa Chanroeun, president of the Cambodian Institute for Democracy thinktank.'DEVELOP TRUST'Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, Chinese vaccine donations have not been as generous as in Cambodia, but purchased Chinese vaccines have been vital in Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.Most of the tens of millions of vaccine doses in Indonesia have been made by Chinese companies.The fact that China made its vaccines available on a large scale created a lot of goodwill, said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a foreign policy expert at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences.While it wouldn't erase strains such as those over the South China Sea, it would make a difference, she said.""If you develop co-operation in low security-sensitive areas and then you develop trust then that prevents conflict. I think that's also the case with China and Indonesia,"" she said.Meanwhile the U.S. programme vaccine donation to Asia is now under way.So far, a total of 7 million shots are to be shared across a region of over 2.5 billion people.

51,Indian experts urge faster inoculations ahead of free COVID-19 shots,"Indian officials and health experts welcomed a federal government plan to give free COVID-19 shots to all adults as a step in the right direction on Tuesday, but cautioned that vaccinations must be accelerated to prevent new surges in infections.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday the federal government would take over the inoculation programme from Indian states and offer free doses to everyone over the age of 18. His announcement on national television followed weeks of criticism of a vaccine rollout that has covered fewer than 5% of India's estimated adult population of 950 million. This has left the country vulnerable to another wave of infections after a surge in April-May which government data showed killed 170,000.""Took him 4 months but after much pressure, he has finally listened to us and implemented what we've been asking all this while,"" Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal state, wrote on Twitter.India has been giving an average of 2.4 million shots a day. Health officials say this is far from adequate for a country as large as India.""We need to vaccinate 7-8 million persons per day to meet the target of covering all the eligible persons before the end of December,"" Giridhara Babu, a member of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country's main health research agency, told Reuters.Babu is part of the national taskforce's working group on epidemiology and surveillance.Daily infections have fallen and officials aim to switch the focus to mass vaccinations. India reported 86,498 new cases overnight, the lowest number in over two months and a sharp drop from a peak of around 400,000 a day in May.  read more India has been inoculating its people with AstraZeneca (AZN.L) shots produced at the Serum Institute of India, and Covaxin made by Indian firm Bharat Biotech. It is set to commercially launch Russia's Sputnik V in mid-June.One reason for the low coverage is that supplies are tight. At Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram hospital, there are no supplies of AstraZeneca, a hospital executive said.Authorities in Delhi have asked hospitals to stop giving the first dose of home-produced Covaxin to people aged from 18 to 44 and focus instead on the elderly until supplies improve, a spokesperson of the party governing the city said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
52,Thrilled to have you: UAE welcomes American Jewish advocacy group,"The American Jewish Committee (AJC) advocacy group said it has opened an office in the United Arab Emirates, its first in the Arab region, in a move welcomed by the Gulf state's foreign minister to promote dialogue.The UAE and Bahrain established ties with Israel last year in U.S.-brokered deals called the Abraham Accords, becoming the first Arab states in more than a quarter century to break what had been a long-standing taboo in the region.""We are thrilled to have you,"" Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan told the group's virtual annual global forum on Monday. ""Your presence in the UAE is ... part of changing mindsets.""Sheikh Abdullah and his Bahraini counterpart Abdullatif Al-Zayani reiterated that the accords, which Sudan and Morocco have also signed, aimed to help bring lasting peace and prosperity through cooperation in fields such as technology and health.""We have to be tolerant to thrive ... in a challenging neighbourhood,"" the Emirati minister said.He said the global effort to ""challenge extremism and radical ideas has not been appropriate"".The UAE, which distrusts Islamist groups, does not allow political parties and shows little tolerance towards dissent. Local media is tightly controlled.The regional trade and tourism hub has pressed on with plans to further ties with Israel, though with less fanfare following Israel-Hamas hostilities last month and what Arab states have described as Israeli provocations in Jerusalem.  read more Sheikh Abdullah said finding a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would require ""strategic"" thinking on both sides.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
53,Mongolia votes for new president amid COVID-19 campaign curbs,"Mongolia goes to the polls on Wednesday to choose its sixth democratically-elected president, with the ruling Mongolian People’s Party (MPP) on the cusp of consolidating its power following a low-key campaign crimped by COVID-19 curbs.The vote is the first after constitutional amendments stripped the office of some of its powers and limited holders to a single six-year term, so keeping incumbent Khaltmaa Battulga of the opposition Democratic Party from seeking re-election.Ukhnaa Khurelsukh, forced to resign as prime minister after protests this year, is the favourite to take over the presidency for the MPP, which already controls parliament and government.The Democratic Party is fielding Sodnomzundui Erdene to replace Battulga.Campaign events in the capital, Ulaanbaatar, have been kept to a minimum as it battles COVID-19. Daily infections hit a record over the last week and Mongolia's deaths stand at 325.""Because of coronavirus there is very little election campaign information, and I will probably decide at the time,"" said a 22-year-old voter, Ganbayar Gantulga.About 1,000 of Khurelsukh's supporters held a rally outside a concert hall on Saturday, but he moved his campaign online a few hours later after his Labor Party rival Dangaasuren Enkhbat, the third election candidate, tested positive for coronavirus.Mongolia's hybrid political system gives parliament the power to make laws and appoint governments, but it also gives the president a veto over legislation.Voters usually chose opposition party candidates as president. Although winners must relinquish party allegiance, they have tended to block legislation on party lines, creating political deadlock that some say has held back the country.Although businessman and former wrestler Battulgahe failed to overturn the decision to exclude him from this year's elections, he remains popular among some voters.""Battulga has done quite a lot for the people,"" said Tsetsegmaa Khasbat, a 67-year-old retiree. ""He is a person who can get things done.""1/5People observing social distancing amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic attend a campaign rally of Sodnomzundui Erdene, presidential candidate of the Democratic Party, ahead of the presidential election, in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia June 3, 2021.

54,"In crackdown on fraud from Myanmar, China authorities target suspects' families","Chinese authorities are trying to lure back fugitive fraudsters operating across the border in Myanmar by threatening to cut off pensions and other benefits for family members, according to social media postings by public security bodies.Since a Feb. 1 coup in Myanmar, economic collapse and lawlessness have created conditions for an upsurge in criminal activity, particularly in northern border areas and by Chinese gangs, according to a report from the United States Institute of Peace.Large-scale criminal groups have long operated in the region, much of it outside the control of the military junta, using it as a base for well-organised telecoms and internet fraud scams, as well as hosting illegal casinos.The actions by local authorities come after China's President Xi Jinping said in April that China will resolutely crack down on telecoms and internet fraud.According to notices from Chinese public security departments in at least five counties early this month, suspects in Myanmar face losing their household registration permit - a key document linked to residence and access to public services - if they don't turn themselves in, and would be unable to return to China.One county in Jiangxi province said it would seek to suspend pensions and medical coverage for the immediate relatives of 33 suspects, giving the names and addresses of the suspects. The notice was later deleted from WeChat.A county in Hunan province said social welfare guarantees for family members of suspects would be cancelled, while houses built using illicit funds would be destroyed and the people residing there would be expelled.The official People's Daily WeChat account reposted one of the notices.The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Public Security did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Much of northern Myanmar, where most of the notices said suspects were located, is under the control of militias, some of which are opposed to the military that seized power in a coup in February, while others support it or have remained neutral.""In the two months since the military reestablished its tumultuous rule, criminal activities in Myanmar have widened dramatically, posing new challenges to the region's efforts and ability to control cross-border crime,"" the United States Institute of Peace, a U.S.-government funded nonpartisan institute, said in its April report.Large tracts of northern Myanmar are also part of the Golden Triangle illicit drug producing region, while areas in the north and north-east that border China and Thailand have a proliferation of illegal casinos that law enforcement authorities say are used for money laundering.A television show released in China this year dramatised efforts by the country's police to fight transnational crimes- including telecoms fraud, committed by or against Chinese nationals abroad. One Southeast Asian region called ""Country M"" featured in the drama.In one 2019 telecoms fraud case involving 10 million yuan  ($1.56 million), Chinese police cooperated with their counterparts in northern Myanmar to bring back 69 Chinese nationals, according to the state-backed China Daily.Security experts fear that the collapsing economy and increased fighting between ethnic militias and the Myanmar military in the wake of the coup will see a surge in illicit activity to finance armed groups. The lure of vice will also be strong for those who have lost their jobs or businesses, they add.($1 = 6.3906 Chinese yuan renminbi)Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
