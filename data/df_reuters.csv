"Mexican rulers' lower house majority to shrink, results show","Mexicans pared back President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's power in elections on Sunday, an official projection based on early results showed, delivering his MORENA party and allies a reduced majority that will make sweeping change more difficult.The National Electoral Institute (INE) saw the ruling coalition winning between 265 and 292 of the 500 seats in the lower house, short of the two thirds majority needed to push through amendments to the constitution.The mid-term election was seen as a referendum on the president's policies and his shake-up of Mexico's institutions.The result, if confirmed, suggests voters want Lopez Obrador to tone down his plans to transform Mexico with an overhaul of politics and the economy. He has also toyed with constitutional changes to protect state energy companies.Since taking office in 2018 after a landslide victory, he has strengthened the role of the state in the energy sector and radically cut back on the cost of government to channel resources to the poor and his priority infrastructure projects.In the process, critics say, he has eroded institutional checks and balances and frequently criticized autonomous bodies, including the Bank of Mexico, prompting adversaries to sound the alarm about his concentration of power.The forecast outcome of the lower house election was in line with opinion polls late in the race, which showed Lopez Obrador's coalition losing some of its grip on the contest after a deadly metro accident in May and sexual abuse allegations against some of its most prominent candidates.Mexicans also chose 15 state governors and state lawmakers on Sunday. Results are still coming in. Opinion polls in recent days showed MORENA winning most of the 15 governors' races.'NOT HAPPY'The contest has taken place amid the COVID-19 pandemic and high levels of violent crime, with 91 politicians killed in this election cycle, according to security consultancy Etellekt.With security forces ramping up their presence in violence-plagued states Baja California, Guerrero, Michoacan and Sonora ahead of the election, crime was a top concern for many voters.In one incident on Sunday, a man threw a severed head at a voting station in the Terrazas del Valle neighborhood of the border city Tijuana as people voted. read more To stay on top in the long term, MORENA must improve its record on crime and the economy, officials, lawmakers and voters say. Mexico's economy contracted 8.5% in 2020, the most since the Great Depression of the 1930s, though it is now clawing back ground, lifted by U.S. demand. read more Olivia Aguirre, a 32-year-old academic in Mexico City who voted for Lopez Obrador in 2012 and 2018, said she was disillusioned with the president for his dismissal of women's protests against various problems including violence, a lack of support for renewable energy and what she called the ""authoritarian"" drift of his government.""I'm not happy about the direction the country is headed,"" she said after voting for the opposition in the city's Roma district.Many of her friends who had supported him felt the same way, though her parents still backed MORENA, she said. Early results pointed to setbacks in the capital for the ruling party.Even so, while voters have been critical of the government's record on job creation and fighting crime, skepticism of Mexico's former rulers, now in opposition, is marked. Lopez Obrador has also benefited from a coronavirus vaccine rollout.  read more The INE projections showed only moderate gains for the opposition coalition despite robust campaigning portraying Lopez Obrador as a danger to democracy.Voter Luis Dominguez, 36, in the small municipality of Cuaxomulco in the southeastern state of Tlaxcala said he was standing by the president.""We have to support him so he can complete his mission,"" said Dominguez.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Thailand starts long awaited COVID-19 vaccination drive,"Thailand kicked off a long-awaited mass vaccination campaign on Monday as the country battles its third and worst wave of the coronavirus epidemic.The government aims to administer 6 million doses this month, hoping to ease worries over the highly anticipated roll-out and concerns about supply shortages.""The government will ensure that everyone is vaccinated,"" Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said in televised comments after he visited an inoculation centre in Bangkok.There were, however, early hiccups as some vaccine centres registered more than their quota, leading to postponements, senior health official Opas Karnkawinpong told a news conference.""We apologise if your vaccination appointment was postponed, but will make sure you are registered at the earliest,"" Opas said.Hospitals last week delayed vaccinations for nearly 40,000 people, citing a limited supply.  read more Thailand escaped the worst of the coronavirus pandemic as it hit other countries hard last year, but is now grappling with its deadliest outbreak. Officials have scrambled to source more vaccines amid the third wave, which so far accounts for more than 80% of its 179,886 total infections and 1,269 fatalities.Authorities on Monday said 235 cases of the B.1.617.2 variant, which ravaged India, had spread to nine provinces since it was first detected in Bangkok last month.The outbreaks has highlighted criticisms of the country's vaccine programme for an over-reliance on AstraZeneca shots produced by royal-owned Siam Bioscience, a slow roll-out and a confusing registration system.On Monday morning, 986 vaccination centres reported a total of 143,116 people received shots. That adds to 2.8 million people deemed vulnerable, including frontline health and transport workers.""My feeling is that no matter what, we will need to go outside of home for the littlest things, so getting the vaccine gives us a sense of relief,"" said Praepawee Lertpongkijja, 38, at a Bangkok vaccination centre.VACCINE SUPPLIESThe 6 million doses to be administered this month will be a mix of AstraZeneca (AZN.L) and imported Sinovac (SVA.O) vaccines.Concerns were raised last week over local production of the AstraZeneca vaccine by Siam Bioscience's after the Philippines said its order had been reduced and delayed.  read more The health ministry on Monday said it will receive an additional 3.42 million doses from AstraZeneca after mid-June said, did not specify how much would be locally made.It received 1.8 million locally-produced AstraZeneca shots on Friday.

Afghan schoolgirl determined to return to school after deadly blast,"Teenager Fatima Noori and her fellow pupils hug and pray as they gather in their Kabul classroom, just weeks after bombs exploded right outside the school gates, killing scores of their classmates.The Sayed Ul-Shuhada High School in the west of the city has remained closed since the May 8 bombings, but a local NGO and the Ministry of Public Health have been holding psychotherapy classes there for girls to help with any trauma.""When I first entered the school (after the blast) to attend the psychotherapy class, I was very scared and worried that the same incident might happen again,"" 15-year-old Fatima told Reuters last month. ""I even fainted near the school gate.""But Fatima said her resolve had grown since then and she was determined to return to school, even with the potential threat of another explosion.""I want to come back to school even more strongly than before and continue my studies,"" she said. ""I want to continue the path of those who were martyred.""Girls and boys at the high school study in three shifts. The May 8 attack targeted the second shift, which is for female students, Najiba Arian, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education, told Reuters.Fatima was in the school corridor getting ready to go home when the first bomb exploded outside the school gate. Two more bombs detonated as people rushed to escape.

But the minority Hazara neighbourhood where the school is located has repeatedly been targeted by militants.The United States and many other Western nations have touted girls' education as one of the key successes of years of foreign presence in Afghanistan.More than 3.5 million girls are now enrolled in school in the country, according to USAID, compared to none during the Taliban's rule from 1996 to 2001. But an estimated 3.7 million children remain out of school, 60% of them girls, according to UNICEF.Security is deteriorating as foreign forces prepare to leave Afghanistan later this year, emboldening some hard-line Islamist groups to threaten the progress made in girls' education.Fatima's father, 36-year-old Taqi Noori, said he thought about, but decided against, leaving the country.""There is always war in Afghanistan, but what can we do? This is our country ... if we go somewhere else, my children would be deprived of education,"" he said from their hillside home, about a 10-minute walk from Fatima's school.Fatima has continued her studies at home as she waits for the school to reopen, the timing of which remains uncertain.""I am interested in medical science, and I want to become a good doctor in the future to treat our security forces injured while defending our people, land, and our borders.""Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Swiss to vote on whether to become first European nation to ban synthetic pesticides,"Switzerland could become the first European country to ban artificial pesticides in a June 13 referendum which backers of the initiative hope will trigger similar prohibitions elsewhere.Globally, only Bhutan has a complete ban on synthetic pesticides, according to supporters aiming to outlaw the use of products made by agro-chemical giants such as Switzerland's Syngenta and Germany's Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and BASF (BASFn.DE).Supporters of the ban say the artificial products cause serious health problems and reduce biodiversity. Manufacturers say their pesticides are rigorously tested and regulated, can be used safely and crop yields would slump without them.Another initiative to be voted on the same day aims to improve the quality of Switzerland's drinking water and food by stopping direct subsidies to farmers who use artificial pesticides and antibiotics in livestock.Switzerland has been starkly divided by an unusually bitter debate over the initiatives and the votes look set to be close. A recent Tamedia poll showed 48% of voters favoured the drinking water initiative and 49% supported the pesticide ban.If adopted, the proposals give farmers up to 10 years to make the transition, which would allow Switzerland to become a pioneer in organic food as well as an example to the rest of the world, Swiss wine maker Roland Lenz said.""Clean water, one of the foundations of life, is endangered,"" said Lenz, a 51-year-old organic farmer, whose vineyard is surrounded by farmers opposing the initiative.Syngenta, which is headquartered in Switzerland and owned by China National Chemical Corporation, opposes both initiatives, saying a ban would reduce agricultural yields by up to 40%.""The consequences of not using them are clear: fewer regional products, higher prices, and more imports. This is not in the interest of consumers, nor is it in the interest of the environment,"" a Syngenta spokesman said.LIFE UNDER SIEGEThe clean water initiative also wants farmers to stop using imported animal feed, to restrict the numbers of cows, pigs and chickens in Switzerland along with the manure they produce that can pollute drinking water.""People have been sold a romantic image of farming in Switzerland, which is far removed from reality,"" said Pascal Scheiwiller, a backer of the clean water campaign, which estimates 1 million Swiss people drink contaminated water.The Swiss Farmers Union said many of its members feel their way of life is under siege.""A lot of people in cities think if they have two tomatoes growing on the balcony of their apartment they understand farming,"" said Martin Haab, president of the Zurich Farmers Association.""I look back 200 years ago when we couldn't protect our plants and animals, and we had hunger in Switzerland and all over Europe,"" said Haab.Martin's son Dominic, who runs a dairy farm outside Zurich, said the consequences for the rural economy would be brutal, with local businesses also being hit by a fall in animal numbers to comply with the fodder restrictions.Wine maker Lenz, however, said to continue using pesticides was ""sheer lunacy"", especially when it was possible to use methods such as growing fruit with thicker skins to make them fungus resistant.“With a ‘Yes’ vote on both initiatives, we will finally move from the chemical age back to the organic age,” he said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Analysis: India’s vaccine inequity worsens as countryside languishes,"Urban Indians are getting COVID-19 shots much faster than the hundreds of millions of people living in the countryside, government data shows, reflecting rising inequity in the nation’s immunisation drive.In 114 of India's least developed districts - collectively home to about 176 million people - authorities have administered just 23 million doses in total.That's the same number of doses as have been administered across nine major cities -- New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Thane and Nagpur -- which combined have half the population of the least developed districts.The disparity was even stronger last month, after the government allowed private sales of vaccines for adults aged under 45 years, an offer which favoured residents of cities with larger private hospital networks. For the first four weeks of May, those nine cities gave 16% more doses than the combined rural districts, data from the government’s Co-WIN vaccination portal shows.""My friends from the city were vaccinated at private hospitals,"" said Atul Pawar, a 38-year-old farmer from Satara, a rural western district of Maharashtra, India's wealthiest state. ""I am ready to pay, but doses are not available and district borders are sealed because of the lockdown.""The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said in a statement on Saturday that reports of vaccine inequity in India were ""inaccurate and speculative in nature"".""Liberalised pricing and accelerated national COVID-19 vaccination strategy ensures vaccine equity,"" it said, adding that smaller cities were also getting doses like the big ones.The ministry said it had asked states with fewer private hospitals to review the status of their vaccination campaigns and encourage some government-empanelled hospitals to strike deals with vaccine companies if need be.India has administered more than 222 million doses since starting its campaign in mid-January - only China and the United States have administered more - but it has given the required two doses to less than 5% of its 950 million adults.Rural India is home to more than two-thirds of the country's 1.35 billion people. While urban areas account for a disproportionately large share of the confirmed COVID-19 cases, those concerned about the spread of the virus in the countryside say statistics undercount cases in villages, where testing is less comprehensive.The health system in several regions in India collapsed in April and May as the country reported the world’s biggest jump in coronavirus infections, increasing pressure on the immunisation programme.1/2Suresh Kumar, 43, ties up the hair of his wife Pramila Devi, 36, who is suffering from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), before taking her to a local government dispensary, at their home in Kaljikhal, in the northern state of Uttarakhand, India, May 23, 2021./File PhotoRead MorePrime Minister Narendra Modi's government offers vaccines to vulnerable people, healthcare workers and those aged over 45 for free. Since last month, individual states have also been expected to procure vaccines for younger adults, or to provide them commercially through the private sector.Poorer states say this leaves their residents more vulnerable. The eastern state of Jharkhand, where nearly all districts are categorised as poor, this week urged Modi to give it free vaccines for all age groups.In many states the doses for those under 45 are available mostly or entirely in urban areas. Some officials say this is intentional, as the infection spreads more easily in crowded cities.""It's because of high-positivity"" in urban areas, said Bijay Kumar Mohapatra, health director of the eastern state of Odisha, explaining the state's decision to prioritise cities.Major international and domestic firms such as Microsoft (MSFT.O), Pepsi (PEP.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Reliance Industries (RELI.NS), Adani Group and Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) have organised inoculations for their employees, in many cases in partnership with private hospitals. Most of these companies and the huge private hospitals that serve them are located in urban centres.Vaccination rates in rural areas have also been depressed because of patchier internet access to use the complex online system for signing up for shots, and possibly because of greater hesitancy among villagers than among city dwellers.""LUCRATIVE DEALS""India's Supreme Court criticised the government's handling of the vaccination programme this week and ordered it to provide a breakdown of shots given in rural and urban areas.""Private hospitals are not equally spread out"" across the country and ""are often limited to bigger cities with large populations"", the top court said in its order dated May 31.""As such, a larger quantity will be available in such cities, as opposed to the rural areas,"" it said. Private hospitals may prefer to sell doses ""for lucrative deals directly to private corporations who wish to vaccinate their employees"".Dr. Rajib Dasgupta, head of the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said the risk of inequity was that parts of India would build up immunity disproportionately.“It can leave the rural population relatively more vulnerable.”Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Meghan and Harry name baby daughter after Queen Elizabeth and Diana,"Meghan, Britain’s Duchess of Sussex, has given birth to her second child, a girl, whom she and husband Prince Harry have named after Queen Elizabeth and his late mother Princess Diana.Lilibet 'Lili' Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born on Friday at the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in California, with Harry in attendance. The couple's first child, Archie, was born in 2019.The choice of name pays tribute to the queen after a difficult year for the couple, and the wider royal family. Lilibet is a family nickname for the 95-year-old British monarch.Buckingham Palace said the queen, Harry’s father Prince Charles and his brother and wife, Prince William and Kate, were delighted with the news. Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined them in sending his congratulations.William and Kate said via their official Twitter account: ""We are all delighted by the happy news of the arrival of baby Lili. Congratulations to Harry, Meghan and Archie.""Meghan and Harry announced the birth with a statement.""On June 4th, we were blessed with the arrival of our daughter, Lili. She is more than we could have ever imagined, and we remain grateful for the love and prayers we've felt from across the globe,"" they said.""Thank you for your continued kindness and support during this very special time for our family.""Harry and Meghan said Lilibet's middle name was chosen to honour her grandmother, Princess Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997.Both mother and baby - who is eighth in line to the throne - were doing well and were back at home, their press secretary said.The nature of the announcement, almost two days after the birth, reflects the new life the couple have chosen in the United States.When William's wife Kate gave birth to her three children in recent years, she emerged each time alongside her husband from a London hospital just a few hours later to be photographed by the world's media that had camped out in the street.1/6Britain's Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, attend a roundtable discussion on gender equality at Windsor Castle, Windsor, Britain October 25, 2019. Jeremy Selwyn/Pool via ReutersRead MoreCRISISThe birth of Lilibet comes almost a year and a half after Harry and Meghan announced that they intended to step down from their royal roles, plunging the family into crisis.The situation deteriorated sharply in March this year when they gave an explosive interview to U.S. chat show host Oprah Winfrey, accusing one unnamed royal of making a racist remark and saying Meghan's pleas for help when she felt suicidal were ignored.The 39-year-old, whose mother is Black and father is white, said she had been naive before marrying into royalty.Harry, 36, and Meghan live in a secluded $14 million mansion in the celebrity enclave of Montecito, about 80 miles (130 km) north of Los Angeles, which is also home to Winfrey, comedian Ellen DeGeneres, and other celebrities.Harry's last major public appearance was at a VAX Live concert in Los Angeles on May 2. Meghan appeared by video at the concert, which aimed to boost vaccinations worldwide against the coronavirus.Meghan disclosed in a November 2020 essay that she suffered a miscarriage in July 2020.After the interview with Winfrey, Harry made further public criticism of his childhood, creating another public relations problem for the royal family which is led by the queen and 72-year-old Prince Charles.Just last month Harry spoke of the trauma of the loss of his mother and how that was compounded when he had to walk as a 12-year-old behind her coffin in a funeral cortege under the glare of the world's media.The queen, who lost her husband Prince Philip in April after 73 years of marriage, has said she was saddened to learn of the experiences of Harry and Meghan.The couple said they would be taking parental leave from their charity Archewell and have asked people who want to send gifts to support or learn about charities doing work for women and girls, the Archewell website said.The names given to the baby also echo those given to the only daughter of Prince William, Harry’s elder brother, who is called Charlotte Elizabeth Diana.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Taxi for hire! Bangkok cabbie hopes to capitalise on his COVID-19 shot,"After losing countless fares during the pandemic, Thai taxi driver Sombat Subin has sought to reassure nervous clients by letting them know in three languages on the sign above his cab that he has been vaccinated against COVID-19.""I think the lit-up sign creates confidence for passengers and I feel that it has also helped increase my income,"" said Sombat, from Nonthaburi, a province north of Bangkok.The 43-year-old said the sign, which reads ""Vaccine"" and then ""COVID"" with a tick next to it and appears in Thai, English and Mandarin, was a conversation piece in his taxi.""It's to confirm to them that the driver has been fully vaccinated... So, the passengers are not afraid,"" he said.Sombat said he became a taxi driver three years ago after finding working in an office stifling. Before the pandemic, he earned about 60,000 baht ($1,920) a month, but this has slumped to as little as 10,000 baht during the latest wave of infections.Thailand had managed to largely contain virus cases for much of last year, but since April has struggled to quell its most serious outbreak so far that includes more contagious variants.This has increased pressure on authorities to speed up vaccinations with the country's rollout lagging many neighbours.Only 2.7 million Thais have received a first vaccine dose and the government has been scrambling to source more.Authorities have tried to prioritize frontline workers including taxi drivers and public transport staff.Kanokwan Sattawong, a passenger in Sombat's taxi, said: ""I feel more confident when drivers are fully vaccinated and feel safe to use public transportation.""Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Pakistani train smashes into derailed carriages; 36 killed,"A train in Pakistan smashed into derailed carriages of another train on Monday, killing at least 36 people, government officials said, in the latest accident to highlight the perilous state of a more-than-165 year old railway system.The death toll was likely to rise as rescuers struggled to reach people trapped in several mangled compartments strewn across the tracks in the southern province of Sindh.A Pakistan Railways spokesman said at least 33 bodies had been taken to hospitals, among them two railway officials. More than 100 people were injured, he told Reuters.Police officer Umar Tufail said the toll rose to 36, and that his men could see four more bodies stuck in the wreckage.""We have not been able to take them out so far, but an operation is underway for that,"" he told reporters at the site. ""We have saved three more people; they are injured,"" he added.An injured passenger, who had been travelling on the train that derailed, recounted how one calamity led to another.""We felt as if we had been thrown away,"" the man, who had a bandaged head, told a television reporter from hospital, speaking of the initial derailing of his train.""The second train then hit our train that caused more damage,"" he said.The Pakistan Railways spokesman said several carriages of the first train fell across the adjacent track after the derailment in the Ghotki district.1/5Paramilitary soldiers and rescue workers gather at the site following a collision between two trains in Ghotki, Pakistan June 7, 2021. REUTERS/StringerRead MoreThe second train, coming from the other direction, then smashed into them, he added.""The driver tried to apply emergency brakes but the locomotive hit the infringing coaches,"" Pakistan Railways said in an initial report.""The track has got issues on several points, the coaches are old, some as old as 40 years,"" railway official Khalid Latif told Geo News TV.""I've told high-ups several times 'please do something about it',"" he said.Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Twitter he was shocked by the ""horrific"" accident and was ordering a comprehensive investigation into railway safety.Accidents on the decrepit system are common.In 2005, in the same district about 130 people were killed when a crowded passenger train rammed into another at a station and a third train hit the wreckage.Successive governments have been trying to secure funds to upgrade the system for years. Recently, Pakistani officials have been hoping China might help to finance work on the network as part of its Belt and Road Initiative of energy and infrastructure projects.“It’s very unfortunate,” Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said of the crash. “Our railway system has needed an overhaul for a long time.”Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Mexican president vows focus on poor after mixed election results,"Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday vowed to double down on helping the poor after a mid-term election that clipped his wings in Congress with a reduced majority but handed a clutch of new state governments to his candidates.A preliminary estimate by the National Electoral Institute (INE) after Sunday's elections put Lopez Obrador's ruling coalition on course to win between 265 and 292 of the 500 lower-house seats, short of the two-thirds majority he managed to muster in the first half of his term.Since taking office in 2018, Lopez Obrador has redirected the federal budget to welfare programs and building infrastructure including a refinery and a train.Asked how he would respond to the outcome of the elections he said he was committed to doing more for the poor.""For me it's a source of pride that the humblest and poorest are the ones who most support the program of transformation,"" he said.Lopez Obrador thanked voters for ensuring his political project would still have a majority in the lower house, and with it, the control of the budget.However, the lower-house losses are likely to curb his scope to pursue constitutional changes to bolster his drive to tighten state control of the energy sector.The outcome was roughly in line with final opinion polls, which showed the race tightening after a fatal metro accident in Mexico City and accusations that Lopez Obrador had intervened excessively in the campaign.Investors saw the election as positive for Mexico's risk outlook. The peso gained as much as 1.1% to 19.7382 to the dollar to a three-week high. Lopez Obrador has attacked his predecessors as corrupt and in hock to corporate interests who fomented poverty, inequality and violence. But he has struggled to deliver on pledges to combat gang violence and lift anemic growth.Capitalizing on discontent over his record, the opposition made gains in Mexico City, provisional results showed.The capital has been a bastion for Lopez Obrador since he rose to national prominence as mayor from 2000 to 2005. The early results suggested MORENA had lost control of a number of the capital's 16 boroughs, which it previously dominated.""We need a government that's more open to what business is proposing,"" said Enrique Prendas, 56, a Mexico City resident who voted for Lopez Obrador in 2018 but this time switched his vote to the center-right National Action Party (PAN).However Lopez Obrador and allies may be on track to win 11 of 15 state government races, enlarging the party's footprint across the country.Lopez Obrador's leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) went into the vote with 253 seats in the lower house. According to INE projections, it will win between 190 and 203.The new lower house will be seated in September.MORENA and its allies won 42.5% of votes cast for the lower house, according to a preliminary count of 89% of ballots. The main opposition alliance was slightly behind on 40.0%.MORENA's individual tally was far ahead of its nearest rival, giving it a clear advantage in picking up seats from the 300 awarded under a first-past-the-post system. The remaining 200 house seats are divvied up via proportional representation.To defend its majority, MORENA will rely on votes from the Labor Party (PT) and the Green Party, a political grouping that has proven adept at forging alliances with whoever is in power.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
ASEAN ministers pressure Myanmar after 'painfully slow' progress,"Southeast Asian foreign ministers mediating on the crisis in Myanmar called on Monday for its military rulers to free prisoners and start an agreed political dialogue, expressing disappointment at ""very slow"" progress so far.The United Nations, Western countries and China back the effort by the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to find a way out of the crisis in Myanmar, a country paralysed by turmoil since a Feb. 1 coup that ended a decade of tentative democracy.Vivian Balakrishnan, foreign minister of Singapore, a key investor in Myanmar, said the ASEAN diplomatic effort ""only makes sense if there is a genuine desire within Myanmar itself for genuine dialogue and negotiations and reconciliation.""To be honest with you, we are disappointed at the slow – very, very slow progress,"" he told Singapore media in a call from Chongqing, China, where ASEAN foreign ministers met their Chinese counterpart on Monday.Myanmar's junta has shown little sign of heeding a consensus reached in April among the 10 ASEAN countries, including Myanmar, which calls for an end to violence, political talks and the naming of a regional special envoy.""Indonesia is really hoping that the implementation of the five points of consensus needs to be pushed after this meeting with, once again, a transparent process,"" Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi told a news conference.Malaysian Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said ASEAN must admit that progress on the consensus was ""painfully slow"".""The int'l (international) community is awaiting ASEAN's further action,"" he said on Twitter.In a summary of remarks read at the meeting, he said ASEAN ""must act more quickly to reduce tensions and stop violence"".The junta has struggled to impose control since ousting elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, which triggered a wave of anger, protests and strikes, and efforts to build a nationwide alliance to thwart the military's bid to consolidate power.TRIAL LOOMSNobel laureate Suu Kyi, 75, will go on trial next week in the first of several criminal cases against her, according to her lawyer, who met her on Monday for a court hearing.The charges include illegal possession of two-way radios, breaking coronavirus protocols, and bribery.The trial must be concluded by July 26, chief lawyer Khin Maung Zaw told Reuters, citing the presiding judge. Suu Kyi has been held at an undisclosed location.  read more She is charged separately with violating the Official Secrets Act, punishable by 14 years in jail.The ASEAN ministers' comments follow a visit to Myanmar on Friday by two ASEAN envoys during which they urged the junta to free all detainees and discussed implementing the consensus.The envoys met military chief Min Aung Hlaing and several junta-appointed ministers, in a visit ASEAN did not announce.Unlike his more reclusive predecessors, Min Aung Hlaing has sought to maintain a high public profile since the coup. His public speeches and meetings with foreign dignitaries, businessmen, government officials and Buddhist monks have been a daily staple on state-controlled television.In a statement dated June 5, ASEAN said the objective of the visit was to discuss how Myanmar would reach ""a peaceful solution in the interests of its people"" by implementing the five points.It said they had also ""called for the release of all political prisoners, including women and children and foreigners"" - an appeal that was not in the consensus but is supported by many ASEAN members.Reuters could not reach a junta spokesman for comment on Monday.The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar said the meeting covered ""implementation of the recommendation of initial survey of ASEAN"", the army's plan to hold elections, and ""terror acts"" by its opponents.Opponents of the junta and many people in Myanmar have shown frustration at the lack of tough action by ASEAN and its failure to include other political stakeholders, particularly the ousted government.Min Aung Hlaing met China'a ambassador to Myanmar on Saturday. China's state-run Global Times newspaper quoted the junta leader as saying Myanmar was willing to coordinate implementation of the consensus.It reported that the ambassador had said China was ready to support that.After Monday's meeting, Indonesia's Retno said Chinese help would be ""highly appreciated as this will contribute to achieving a peaceful solution"".Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Peru's Castillo says there is 'hope' as razor-thin margin keeps country on edge,"Socialist presidential candidate Pedro Castillo said Peruvians are a ""people of hope"" on Sunday, with the country on edge as unofficial vote counts showed him and his conservative election rival separated by the thinnest of margins.A quick count of votes cast in Sunday's election, with a 1% error margin by Ipsos Peru, put Castillo, an elementary school teacher and novice politician, ahead by 0.4 of a percentage point.A previous Ipsos exit poll, with a 3% error margin, put his rival in the run-off election, Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of jailed ex-President Alberto Fujimori, up by 0.6 of a percentage point.By 1 a.m. (0600 GMT), the ONPE electoral agency had published partial official results with 61% of votes counted that put Fujimori first with 52.4% of votes and Castillo second with 47.5%. Authorities however cautioned that this count was predominantly urban, where the conservative candidate has an advantage.""We need to have faith in the people,"" Castillo said. ""Our votes still remain to be counted, the votes of the provinces.""The quick-count results triggered celebrations and cries of ""we won"" from Castillo's supporters in Tacabamba, the Andean town closest to the impoverished village where he was born and raised, which is also where he is waiting for the results.Hundreds gathered in Tacabamba's main square before midnight for a concert with a pro-Castillo presenter telling the crowd: ""yes we can"". The concert appeared to violate an 11 p.m. curfew linked to the coronavirus, which has hit Peru particularly hard.A tight race could lead to days of uncertainty as counts trickle in, and could trigger unrest if disillusioned supporters of either candidate question the results.Castillo had earlier called his supporters onto the streets after an exit poll gave a slender lead to Fujimori. But he has not made any official comment since the quick count put him as the likely winner, and neither has Fujimori.""I ask our people to defend every vote,"" Castillo wrote on Twitter when the early forecast suggested he would lose. ""I call on Peruvian people from all corners of the country to go to the streets in peace to be vigilant in the defence of democracy.""Speaking before the quick count via megaphone from a balcony to crowds in Tacabamba, Castillo appealed for calm.""We must be prudent, the people are wise,"" said the 51-year-old schoolteacher who has vowed to redistribute wealth and rewrite the constitution. ""What we have heard is not official.""Fujimori said she was reserving judgement until the official results. She also appealed for ""prudence, calm and peace from both groups, those who voted and did not vote for us.""CROWDS GATHERReuters witnesses reported a small crowd of people gathering outside the headquarters of Castillo's Peru Libre party in the capital, Lima.Opinion polls up to election day had indicated a statistical dead heat, with Fujimori, who had earlier trailed Castillo, pulling slightly ahead at the end of campaigning.  read more Polls showed urban and higher-income citizens prefer Fujimori, while the rural poor largely support Castillo.Both candidates have pledged vastly different remedies for rescuing Peru from the economic doldrums brought on by the COVID-19 crisis, which has seen it lead the world in per capital deaths.Fujimori, a 46-year-old who has tilted at the presidency twice before, has pledged to follow the free-market model and maintain economic stability in the world’s second-largest copper producer.Castillo, the son of peasant farmers, has promised to redraft the constitution to strengthen the role of the state, take a larger portion of profits from mining firms and nationalize key industries.Voting in the Lima district of Surco on Sunday afternoon, Fujimori noted a handful of allegations of doctored voting papers discovered in the capital and the country´s interior.""We know that there have been incidents today. We hope that the electoral bodies will take action on the matter and sanctions will be issued accordingly,"" she said. ""I also expect our party officials to be on their guard.""In Lima, voters made their way to polling stations by bike, roller skates and on foot to traffic jams that built up as the day progressed.Among those casting their vote in Lima was Luis Pizango, who said that for him, ""transparency"" was key.""May Peru win for the good of all Peruvians,"" he said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Hungary appears to back-pedal on Chinese university plans after protests,"Hungary appeared to backtrack on plans to build a Chinese university in the capital Budapest after thousands took to the streets at the weekend accusing the government of cosying up to Beijing, provoking an angry Chinese response.Opponents of nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban fear the planned $2 billion campus could undercut the quality of higher education and help Beijing increase its influence in Hungary and the European Union.  read more A senior Orban aide said late on Sunday the university was not even at the planning phase, and once the plan took shape, in early 2023, it could be put to a referendum.""Once the project's conditions are known, we support a referendum in Budapest to decide whether locals want Fudan University here,"" Gergely Gulyas, Orban's chief of staff, told the pro-government news web site Mandiner late on Sunday.Orban, a self-styled illiberal, has built cordial ties with China, including massive joint business projects, and has several times this year blocked EU statements denouncing China's record on human rights, angering his allies.  read more According to media reports, the government was willing to pay for the construction of Shanghai-based Fudan University's first campus in Europe with a Chinese loan. The campus would displace a planned local student housing area.Public support for the campus is low, according to an opinion survey conducted last month, and Orban's ruling Fidesz party has weak support in Budapest, so a referendum could turn out against the project.Orban and Fidesz face their first competitive elections next year after three successive landslides since 2010. Opposition parties have united against Fidesz for the first time and caught up with them in polls.Political observers say Orban could decide to bide his time on Fudan and return to the idea after the election.""It is hallmark Fidesz to take two steps back to wait until the issue loses political steam, then attempt it again when it is more convenient politically,"" Political Capital analyst Peter Kreko said.Orban has abandoned unpopular projects before, such as a tax on internet traffic, a separate administrative court system and  plans to privatise marinas at Lake Balaton.OPPOSITION SPARS WITH CHINAGergely Karacsony, the opposition mayor of Budapest and a top contender to challenge Orban in elections next year, said on Saturday the university protest was a symbol of Hungarians rejecting heavy-handed government decisions.""Although we are worlds apart on human rights... we really just don't want a Chinese elite school built at the expense of Hungarian taxpayers,"" Karacsony told Saturday's rally.A media spokesman at the Chinese Embassy in Hungary, who did not give his name, criticised Karacsony's comments on the embassy's Facebook page.""In broad daylight, it is unseemly to criticize the internal affairs of another country, especially when I heard some key words in his speech, such as 'Tiananmen Square protests', 'democracy', 'human rights' and 'values',"" the official said.The Chinese embassy said it would address Reuters questions on a planned Fudan referendum at a later stage.Hungary blocked an EU statement in April criticising China's new security law in Hong Kong, undermining the bloc's efforts to confront Beijing's curbing of freedoms in the former British colony.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Hundreds of former leaders urge G7 to vaccinate poor against COVID-19,"One hundred former presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers have urged the Group of Seven (G7) rich nations to pay for global coronavirus vaccinations to help stop the virus mutating and returning as a worldwide threat.The leaders made their appeal ahead of a G7 summit in England which begins on Friday, when U.S. President Joe Biden will meet the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. In their letter to the G7, the former world leaders said global cooperation had failed in 2020, but that 2021 could usher in a new era.""Support from the G7 and G20 that makes vaccines readily accessible to low- and middle-income countries is not an act of charity, but rather is in every country's strategic interest,"" the letter said.Among the signatories were ex-British premiers Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, former U.N. Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon and 15 former African leaders.They said the G7 and other leaders invited to the summit should guarantee to pay what would amount to about $30 billion a year over two years towards fighting the pandemic worldwide.""For the G7 to pay is not charity, it is self-protection to stop the disease spreading, mutating and returning to threaten all of us,"" Brown said.""Costing just 30 pence ($0.43) per person per week in the UK, is a small price to pay a for the best insurance policy in the world,"" he added in a statement.Their plea coincided with a poll by the Save the Children charity which found strong public support in the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Canada for the G7 paying towards the $66 billion needed for COVID-19 vaccines globally.In Britain, 79% were in favour of such a policy, while 79% of Americans backed the proposal, the poll showed.

Australia's Victoria logs biggest rise in COVID-19 cases in a week,"Australia's Victoria state on Monday reported its biggest rise in new locally acquired COVID-19 cases in nearly a week as authorities scramble to track the source of the highly infectious Delta variant found among infections.Authorities reported 11 new cases, up from just two a day earlier, but noted that all were linked to existing clusters, as residents of state capital Melbourne wait to hear if an extended snap lockdown will end as planned on Thursday night.""Nothing is on or off the table,"" Victoria state Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton told reporters in Melbourne, when asked if some areas of the city could remain locked down while other areas start to ease curbs.Melbourne entered its 11th day of a hard lockdown on Monday after officials on Friday found the Delta virus variant, which they said was likely to spread more easily than many other strains, for the first time among infections.The source for the Delta variant infections has yet to be identified and there has been no genomic match so far with any other cases in Australia.The new case numbers take the total number of locally acquired cases in the latest outbreak in Victoria, the country's second-most populous state, to 83.An empty Queen Victoria Market is seen on the first day of a seven-day lockdown as the state of Victoria looks to curb the spread of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Melbourne, Australia, May 28, 2021.

Carbon dioxide in the air at highest level since measurements began,"Despite a massive reduction in commuting and in many commercial activities during the early months of the pandemic, the amount of carbon in Earth's atmosphere in May reached its highest level in modern history, a global indicator released on Monday showed.Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, said the findings, based on the amount of carbon dioxide in the air at NOAA's weather station on Mauna Loa in Hawaii, was the highest since measurements began 63 years ago.The measurement, called the Keeling Curve after Charles David Keeling, the scientist who began tracking carbon dioxide there in 1958, is a global benchmark for atmospheric carbon levels.Instruments perched on NOAA's mountaintop observatory recorded carbon dioxide at about 419 parts per million last month, more than the 417 parts per million in May 2020.Because carbon dioxide is a key driver of climate change, the findings show that reducing the use of fossil fuels, deforestation and other practices that lead to carbon emissions must be a top priority to avoid catastrophic consequences, Pieter Tans, a scientist with NOAA's Global Monitoring Laboratory, said in a report on the emissions.“We are adding roughly 40 billion metric tons of CO2 pollution to the atmosphere per year,” Tans wrote. “That is a mountain of carbon that we dig up out of the Earth, burn, and release into the atmosphere as CO2 - year after year.""The amount of carbon in the air now is as much as it was about 4 million years ago, a time when sea level was 78 feet (24 meters) higher than it is today and the average temperature was 7 degrees Fahrenheit higher than it was before the Industrial Revolution, the report said.Despite the pandemic lockdown, scientists were not able to see a drop in the overall amount of carbon in the atmosphere  partly because of wildfires, which also release carbon, as well as the natural behavior of carbon in the atmosphere, the report said.The carbon dioxide levels measured were not affected by the eruption of Hawaiian volcanoes, Tans said, adding the station is situated far enough from active volcanoes that measurements are not distorted, and occasional plumes of carbon dioxide are removed from the data.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Kremlin critic Dmitry Gudkov says his Russia exit is a tactical retreat,"Russian opposition politician Dmitry Gudkov said on Monday his decision to leave Russia was a temporary and tactical retreat because he could no longer practice politics effectively due to unprecedented pressure from the authorities.Gudkov, who was held in custody for two days last week in a case he said was fabricated, said on Sunday he had left Russia  after receiving warnings from people close to the Kremlin that he would be arrested if he remained in the country. Gudkov, who sat in Russia's lower house of parliament until 2016, had hoped to run for a seat again in September but said the pressure on him and his family from the authorities had made it impossible to pursue politics inside Russia for now.""I want to return to Russia. This is some sort of a temporary retreat, to gather up strength and move on... into the battle,"" he told Reuters in an interview after his arrival in Kyiv.""If I did not leave, they would have started repression against me and my whole family. They gave me very little time,"" he said.""I thought I am not ready to sacrifice the lives and health of my relatives and friends, and allies for the sake of some hypothetical rise to power in 2024,"" he said, referring to the  next Russian presidential election.The Kremlin says that legal cases against Gudkov and other opposition figures ahead of this year's parliamentary election  are not connected to politics.A number of activists critical of the Kremlin have been put under house arrest, fled the country or been jailed on charges they say are politically motivated. He has accused the Kremlin of cracking down on the opposition to make it impossible for independent candidates to run in this year’s parliamentary election. The Kremlin has denied trying to clear the field of political opponents.Gudkov told Ukrainian television on Monday that he would join his parents in Bulgaria after completing previously scheduled engagements in Kyiv.Gudkov's father Gennady is a former politician and Kremlin critic who relocated to the Bulgarian port city of Varna in 2019 as a precaution.Gudkov said he wanted to return to Russia but could not say when. “It is indeed unprecedented pressure,” he told Reuters.    “It is not clear how the situation will develop after the election, from which almost all the prominent critics of the regime have been barred.”Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
EU veto ‘hostage’-taking on foreign policy must end -Germany’s Maas,"Germany’s foreign minister said on Monday the European Union should abolish the right of individual member states to veto foreign policy measures as the 27-nation bloc could not allow itself to be “held hostage”.His comments, which came days after a more junior official criticised Hungary by name, reflect growing frustration in Berlin at the way in which EU member countries can prevent it from acting in matters on which almost all members agree.""We can't let ourselves be held hostage by the people who hobble European foreign policy with their vetoes,"" Heiko Maas told a conference of Germany's ambassadors in Berlin.""If you do that then sooner or later you are risking the cohesion of Europe. The veto has to go, even if that means we can be outvoted.""His remarks amount to a highly unusual rebuke by Germany of a fellow member state. Germany, conscious of its economic and political heft within the EU, is normally very cautious about being seen to throw its weight for fear of seeming overbearing.Hungary blocked an EU statement in April criticising China’s new security law in Hong Kong, undermining EU efforts to confront Beijing’s restrictions of freedoms in the former British colony. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday that the European left, led by the German left, was attacking Hungary because of ""its refusal to sign a politically inconsequential and frivolous joint declaration on Hong Kong"".These declarations make the EU look like a ""pathetic paper tiger,"" Orban wrote on his official website.""There must be an end to the preoccupation in Brussels with concocting and flaunting declarations. ... In recent years this common foreign policy approach, motivated by domestic political considerations, has led to the European Union's foreign policy stance becoming a laughing stock,"" Orban said.He said the EU's foreign policy should be decided by heads of states and governments instead of what he called bureacrats, citing the latest meeting of the European Council regarding Russia as a positive example.""As far as Europe's policy on China is concerned, we believe that we must prevent the reemergence of Cold War policies and culture in world politics,"" the nationalist premier added.Last month, Budapest refused to ratify a new EU trade and development accord with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and also declined to support an EU call for a ceasefire in violence between Israel and the Palestinians.Under Orban, Hungary has pursued closer ties with China, most recently agreeing to host a foreign campus of a Chinese university in Budapest over a chorus of opposition protest.

Bitter week for families as evidence to be read in MH17 airliner trial,"Judges in the Netherlands will begin reading out the evidence this week in the murder trial against four fugitive suspects accused of shooting down a Malaysian airliner over rebel-held eastern Ukraine in 2014 and killing 298 people in 2014.Victims' relatives said they were expecting the testimony to bring up painful memories, but that they were grateful for a chance to hear at last what had happened aboard Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.The flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed in a field in territory held by pro-Russian separatists fighting against Ukrainian forces, after being shot down with what international investigators say was a Russian surface-to-air missile.Three Russians and a Ukrainian citizen, all suspected of having key roles in the separatist forces, are on trial for murder.

From Tuesday the judges will begin summarising the evidence gathered by investigators in the case, and potentially calling witnesses.Judge Hendrik Steenhuis said his panel would be looking specifically to determine what type of missile hit the airplane, where it was fired from and whether the four suspects can be held responsible.""It is taking a long time but we want to know the truth. It is the only thing we can still do for the children,"" said Rob Frederiksz, whose 23-year-old son Bryce died along with his girlfriend Daisy in the crash.After years of collecting evidence, a team of international investigators concluded in May 2018 that the missile launcher used to shoot down the aircraft belonged to Russia's 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade. The Dutch government holds Moscow responsible. Russia denies any involvement.On Monday the Kremlin said it was following the trial and took note of ""alternative information"" that could lead to other explanations of the crash from the Dutch prosecutor's main theory of the Russian-made missile fired by pro-Russian separatists.""But again, because we are not part of the investigation, we cannot directly influence what is happening,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Israeli parliament to vote on approving new government by June 14,"A vote in Israel's legislature on approving a new government poised to unseat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be held within a week, parliament's speaker said on Monday, without setting a specific date.Naftali Bennett, the nationalist politician who would replace Israel's longest-serving leader, called on Netanyahu on Sunday to ""let go"" and drop any efforts to encourage defections from the new coalition that could scupper its inauguration.Bennett urged Knesset Speaker Yariv Levin, a Netanyahu loyalist, not to delay and to hold the confidence vote this Wednesday, so that the government of left-wing, rightist, centrist and Arab parties could be sworn in.In a formal announcement to parliament, Levin noted that opposition leader Yair Lapid had informed him and Israel's president that a coalition had been agreed, and said that under a time frame set by law, a vote to approve it would be held by June 14.""An announcement regarding a date for the session to establish (Israel's) 36th government will be conveyed down the line to members of parliament,"" Levin said, leaving open the possibility that Netanyahu could have up to a week to try to twist arms.If the Lapid-Bennett government fails to win a majority in parliament, Israel will likely head to its fifth election in less than two years, after an inconclusive ballot on March 23 capped by their coalition agreement.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

The fight against drug trafficking needed to be an integral part of tackling corruption, he said.On the immigration front he announced a new processing center for migrants sent back from Mexico and the United States, which could increase capacity.

"Once a lock for ruling party, opposition make electoral gains in Mexican capital","Mexico's sprawling capital has long been a bedrock of support for President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, dating back to his term as mayor years ago, but city voters shifted on Sunday, giving opponents a string of major wins, according to preliminary results.The congressional election in the country looked likely to give Lopez Obrador's allies a majority, albeit slimmed down. In Mexico City, though, his party did not fare so well in elections for borough leaders.While his leftist National Regeneration Movement, known as MORENA, held on to Mexico City's most populous boroughs, including Iztapalapa and Gustavo Madero, it lost nine of the capital's 16 districts.Lopez Obrador blamed the opposition gains on unfriendly press coverage.""You have to keep in mind that this is where there were more attacks from the media,"" said Lopez Obrador, speaking at his regular morning news conference at the national palace in downtown Mexico City.The leftist leader often lashes out at the media, which he derides as mostly elitist and overly concentrated in the capital.More outreach was needed, he said on Monday.Lopez Obrador built up his power base in the capital when he served as mayor from 2000 to 2005, and MORENA took all but four of the boroughs when Lopez Obrador swept to power three years ago in a landslide election victory.But the opposition was able to capitalize on discontent over his record since he became president. He has struggled to deliver on pledges to combat gang violence and lift anemic economic growth.Opposition politicians formed an ideologically diverse coalition to beat out ruling party candidates in the capital.The coalition is made up of the centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), the center-right National Action Party (PAN), and the center-left Democratic Revolution Party (PRD), the later once the political home of Lopez Obrador.In the borough of Cuauhtemoc, MORENA's Dolores Padierna, a veteran politician once affiliated with the PRD, was down by 10% to her main coalition rival, Sandra Xantall Cuevas.But Padierna nonetheless held on to fading hopes for a turnaround late on Sunday.

Senegalese navy seizes 8 tonnes of cannabis resin from boat,"The Senegalese navy on Sunday intercepted a boat smuggling over 8 tonnes of cannabis resin through the waters off the West African nation's coast, the armed forces ministry said in a statement.The vessel, which was flying a Togolese flag, was stopped 140 kilometres (87 miles) from the coastal capital of Dakar with seven crew members on board.After escorting the boat to a naval base in Dakar, the authorities discovered the 8.37 tonnes of hashish split between 279 bags. The boat was also carrying sacks of plaster, the ministry said on Monday.It did not provide a street value for the seized drugs.Earlier this year, authorities in Niger seized 17 tonnes of cannabis resin worth around 31 million euros ($37 million), the largest bust in the country's history.  read more According to Interpol, drug kingpins are sending larger shipments in response to COVID-19 travel restrictions and border closures, which have restricted their ability to more frequently move smaller quantities of drugs via individual couriers.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Salvadoran woman freed from jail after 30-year abortion sentence,"A Salvadoran woman who had served nearly a third of her 30-year prison sentence on charges of terminating her pregnancy and violating El Salvador's harsh abortion ban was released on Monday, activists said.Sara Rogel was arrested in October 2012 after going to a hospital with bleeding injuries caused by what she said was a fall while carrying out chores at home. Then a 22-year-old student, Rogel was prosecuted and sentenced for killing her unborn daughter.""Sara never deserved to be in prison,"" feminist activist Morena Herrera said.

Giuliani pressed Ukrainians to probe Biden allegations in 2019 call - CNN,"The audiotape of a July 2019 phone call shows former U.S. President Donald Trump’s then-lawyer Rudy Giuliani pressuring Ukrainian officials to investigate baseless allegations about Trump’s 2020 election rival Joe Biden, CNN reported on Monday.CNN said it had obtained the audio of the call between Giuliani, U.S. diplomat Kurt Volker, and Andriy Yermak, a senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy which it said was the precursor of a Trump-Zelenskiy call which was at the center of Trump's 2019 impeachment.In the call, Giuliani said he wanted Zelenskiy to say he was putting a prosecutor in charge and ""he's gonna investigate and dig up the evidence, that presently exists and is there any other evidence about involvement of the 2016 election, and then the Biden thing has to be run out,"" according to CNN.Trump, a Republican, denounced as a political witch hunt allegations that he pressed Zelenskiy during a phone call to dig up dirt on Biden.

Harris takes on graft in Guatemala and tells migrants ‘do not come’,"U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said on Monday she had “robust” talks with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei on fighting corruption to deter immigration from Central America and bluntly warned migrants to not come to the United States.Since President Joe Biden took office in January, the number of migrants taken into custody per month at the U.S. Mexico border has risen to the highest levels in 20 years""Do not come. Do not come. The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our borders,"" Harris said at a news conference alongside Giammattei. ""If you come to our border, you will be turned back.""Harris also said a U.S. anti-corruption task force would work with local prosecutors to punish corrupt actors in the region.The Biden administration has identified corruption as an underlying cause of the poverty and violence driving record numbers of Central Americans to go to the United States.The corruption task force has been previously floated, but Harris gave more details, saying it will combine resources from the Justice, State and Treasury departments.In the build-up to Harris' visit to Guatemala, her first official overseas trip, differences of opinion emerged about the fight against graft, with corruption fighters feted by Washington being criticized by Giammattei.""We had a robust, candid and thorough conversation,"" Harris said at the news conference after a three-hour meeting with Giammattei, who said they had discussed U.S. concerns about developments in Guatemala.""The president and I discussed the importance of anti-corruption and the importance of an independent judiciary,"" Harris said. Washington has criticized the removal of a senior judge from Guatemala's top court, in what Giammattei has argued was a legitimate process.Giammattei defended his own record in fighting malfeasance, saying he had not been accused of wrongdoing and saying graft was not only a problem faced by politicians. The fight against drug trafficking needed to be an integral part of tackling corruption, he said.On the immigration front he announced a new processing center for migrants sent back from Mexico and the United States, which could increase capacity.

She said the United States has contributed to regime change and destabilization in Latin America for decades. ""We can't help set someone's house on fire and then blame them for fleeing.""The United States orchestrated a coup against democratically elected leftist government Jacobo Arbenz in 1954, ushering in decades of military governments and a civil war estimated to have killed more than 200,000 people by the time it ended in 1996.More recently, the U.S.-financed, U.N. Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala helped bring down democratically elected conservative President Otto Perez Molina, a former general, who resigned after massive protests triggered by an investigation into corruption in his government.The Biden administration on Monday also unveiled details of another task force of prosecutors to combat human smuggling in Central America and Mexico.U.S. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said the Joint Task Force Alpha would marshal Justice Department and Homeland Security resources against ""the most prolific and dangerous"" human smuggling and trafficking groups in the region, according to a statement. It said the group will complement efforts against corrupt actors.However, Washington's push to tackle ""root causes"" of migration in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras have been undermined by a backlash against anti-corruption bodies the United States considers independent but that local elites say are biased.Harris also met civil society leaders and entrepreneurs in Guatemala. The White House announced a $7.5 million commitment through USAID to support entrepreneurs in Guatemala, as well as millions more in investments in affordable housing, agri-businesses and loans to small businesses.Harris said she discussed sharing COVID-19 vaccines with Guatemala during Monday’s meeting.

"Biden’s to-do list on foreign trip: Rally allies against COVID, Putin","President Joe Biden’s meeting with leaders of the G7 leading industrial economies in an English seaside village this week will usher in a new focus on rallying U.S. allies against common adversaries - the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia and China.New COVID-19 variants and rising death tolls in some countries will loom large during the gathering from Friday to Sunday, alongside climate change, strengthening global supply chains and ensuring the West maintains its technological edge over China, the world's second-largest economy.Biden, a Democrat, vowed to rebuild relations with allies after four rocky years under former President Donald Trump, who pulled Washington out of several multilateral institutions and threatened at one point to quit NATO.""The trip, at its core, will advance the fundamental thrust of Joe Biden's foreign policy to rally the world's democracies to tackle the greatest challenges of our time,"" White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at a briefing on Monday.The gathering will put Biden's ""America is back"" motto to the test, with allies disillusioned during the Trump years looking for tangible, lasting action.TENSIONS WITH RUSSIARussia will be at the forefront of attention at the G7 summit in Cornwall, England, and the days afterward when Biden meets with European leaders and NATO allies in Brussels, before heading to Geneva to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin.U.S. officials are considering sharper action against Russia after two incidents. These are the recent ransomware attack on JBS (JBSS3.SA), the world’s largest meatpacker, by a criminal group likely based in Russia.

Taiwan. So we need to stand up for the rules-based national order,"" he said.On Russia, Stoltenberg said, ""we agree on the dual-track approach, meaning deterrence, defense and dialogue with Russia.""Sullivan said Biden will stress the importance of NATO countries' burden-sharing and the need for allies to contribute to alliance exercises and operations. He added that the United States will respond if Russia's ""harmful"" activities against Washington continue.Sullivan said Biden spoke with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday and reassured him that he would defend Ukraine's sovereignty in his talks with Putin.According to Sullivan, he also said he hoped the G7 nations would come up with an ""action plan"" to increase their collective defenses against ransomware attacks and deal with the challenges posed by cryptocurrency, which, he said, ""lies at the core of how these ransom transactions are played out.""On the sidelines of a NATO summit in Brussels on June 14, Biden is also expected to meet with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, a crucial session between the sparring NATO allies after Ankara's purchase of Russian defense systems angered Washington and risked driving a wedge within the alliance.Sullivan said the talks with Erdogan would be expansive, covering the eastern Mediterranean, Syria and Afghanistan as well as how to deal with the differences that have arisen between the two countries.He said that Biden and Erdogan, who have known each other for many years now, were looking forward to having a ""business-like"" opportunity to have a broad review of bilateral ties.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Portugal minister says Spain requiring COVID-19 test at border 'a mistake',"Portugal's foreign minister said Spain's decision to require a negative COVID-19 test for people crossing the border must have been an error, Lusa news agency reported on Monday.Portugal had asked Spanish authorities for clarification on ""what could only have been a mistake"", Portugal's foreign minister Augusto Santos Silva said.""We have asked Spanish authorities for clarification and await it being granted as quickly as possible, because if not we will need to adopt equivalent reciprocal measures,"" Santos Silva said, adding that ""the epidemiological situation in Spain is, at the moment, worse than what we are living in Portugal.""The land border between the two Iberian nations reopened on May 1 after three months of restrictions and checks, providing relief to local tourist hotspots.Currently, Spain requires air travellers to be tested or vaccinated, while Portugal requires a negative test from travellers from Spain. But neither country had required tests for people crossing the border by land.A Spanish health ministry spokesperson said people crossing the border would be obliged to carry health documentation in the same way that a driver is expected to have their vehicle's papers in case of sporadic checks.The protocol is exactly the same as that applied at Spain's other border with northern neighbour France, the spokesperson said, adding that cross-border workers and transport sector employees would be exempt.The website for the General Consulate of Spain in Portugal said on Monday that all those aged 6 and above crossing the land border from Portugal to Spain must have a negative COVID-19 test, proof of vaccination, or proof of an antibody test.Spain's Health Ministry website said that all travellers from 'high risk' zones needed to show a negative PCR test upon entry from June 7.

Gangs raid police stations for weapons in Haiti as deadly violence surges,"Gangs raided multiple police stations for weapons in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, in deadly attacks over the weekend as violence between armed groups flared, with intense conflict in one southern neighborhood forcing thousands to flee.The gangs have proliferated in the poorest country in the Americas over the past few years during a period of political unrest and growing economic misery. Armed groups increasingly outgun Haiti's security forces and fight with one another over territory.The United Nations said on Sunday it was ""profoundly worried"" about the impact of the growing violence on civilians, recalling similar incidents over the past year that forced thousands to flee.Haiti is also facing a surge in COVID-19 cases and is bracing for a referendum at the end of June over a new constitution.Attackers raided six police stations over the weekend, killing three police officers and burning their bodies in one attack, local news outlets reported. In another, a police inspector who refused to hand over weapons was shot to death.The head of the national police, Leon Charles, confirmed two of the attacks and the inspector's death, telling a news conference on Sunday that authorities were intensifying efforts to combat the gangs.He said police had restored control of a highway leading south from the capital that had been blocked by gang warfare around the troubled neighborhood of Martissant since last Wednesday.The latest flare-up appeared to have killed about 10 people - including civilians - and forced thousands to flee the area as assailants torched homes and businesses, the office of civil protection said in a statement.Videos on social media last week showed bodies along the empty highway that was manned by gunmen. The videos also showed displaced people, including children, taking refuge in a church, in a market square and at a sports center.Fresh produce ran low in Port-au-Prince as trucks carrying supplies from the south were blocked.""The phenomenon of gangsterization is taking on more and more alarming proportions,"" the office of civil protection said, adding there were conflicts in at least three other neighborhoods of the capital.

North Korea’s Kim meets senior officials to address economy - KCNA,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un convened a meeting of senior officials of the Workers’ Party to evaluate and improve the  economy in the second half of the year, state media KCNA reported on Tuesday.Kim is seeking a greater role in government to lift up an economy battered by international sanctions aimed at stopping its nuclear programme, and strict border closures to ward off the coronavirus.North Korea has not officially confirmed any COVID-19 cases, although Seoul officials have said an outbreak there cannot be ruled out as the North had trade and people-to-people exchanges with China before closing its border early last year. In April Kim had urged ruling party officials to wage another “Arduous March” of work and sacrifice, linking the current economic crises to a period in the 1990s of famine and disaster.

Women score historic wins in Mexico’s mid-term elections,"Women were poised to win a record number of state governors’ offices in Mexican mid-term elections on Sunday, capturing territory long dominated by men and giving them a bigger political platform to reach the presidency one day.Preliminary tallies by electoral authorities on Monday showed female candidates securing six of the 15 regional bastions on offer, just two shy of the total number of women ever elected to lead regional governments in Mexico's history.Five of the six went to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), which dominated the state votes, even as the leftist party’s hold on the lower house of Congress weakened. If results are confirmed, it means the northern border states of Baja California and Chihuahua, Guerrero and Colima on the Pacific coast, as well as Tlaxcala in the center and Campeche in the south, will be governed by women.""This is a cultural shift,"" said MORENA lawmaker Gabriela Cuevas, the first Mexican to head the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a global body of national parliaments. ""And definitely a step forward for women in our country and in political life.""Only eight women had previously won regional elections, including the current mayor of Mexico City, MORENA's Claudia Sheinbaum, who is regarded as one of the favorites to succeed Lopez Obrador as president.Since Griselda Alvarez was chosen to run Colima in 1979 - a few weeks after Margaret Thatcher made history as Britain's first woman Prime Minister - Mexico's handful of female governors very rarely overlapped with other women in the job.Now seven out of the 32 regional governments, including Mexico City, will be run by women simultaneously.That is likely to create space for a different kind of politics where women's concerns gain in prominence, said Francisco Abundis, head of Mexican polling firm Parametria.That was especially true as three of the new governors are under 40 and may have long careers ahead of them, he noted.VOTER STRENGTHThe latest national census showed there are roughly 3 million more women than men among Mexico's population of 126 million, and political leaders are increasingly at pains to ensure equal representation in government.Lopez Obrador made history in 2018 by appointing a cabinet split evenly between men and women, though he has come under fire from women's groups for failing to take seriously enough issues like domestic violence and abortion rights.Many women were angry about Lopez Obrador's support for MORENA's original candidate for Guerrero, Felix Salgado, whose campaign was dogged by rape accusations.Salgado denied the allegations but was eventually forced out of the race by electoral authorities for campaign finance irregularities. He was replaced by his daughter Evelyn, who won Guerrero on Sunday night, the results showed.Some Mexicans argue that male domination is still too deeply entrenched in the country for a female president to be realistic as soon as 2024, when the next election is due.""Because of the macho mentality,"" argued Gypsy Lara, a 29-year-old business owner in Mexico City who said she would be happy to back Sheinbaum for president.Sheinbaum, whose popularity took a hit last month over a metro accident that killed 26 people, had a tough night on Sunday with MORENA suffering shock losses in city elections.Despite the setbacks, the 58-year-old is still one of the strongest candidates for the presidency, said Abundis.""I think (female candidates) will be one of the cards to play in 2024,"" he said. ""With everything we're seeing in terms of gender-based movements in the country and the world, in Mexico it's more of a contrast with the whole macho tradition.""Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Top Japanese virologist warns of risks of Tokyo Games during pandemic-paper,"A top Japanese virologist and government adviser has said there was a risk of spreading COVID-19 infections during the Tokyo Olympics, the Times of London reported on Tuesday, the latest high-profile warning about the global sporting showpiece.Tohoku University professor Hitoshi Oshitani was an architect of Japan's ""Three Cs” approach to the pandemic, which advises avoiding closed spaces, crowds and close contact situations.“The government and the organising committee, including the IOC (International Olympic Committee), keep saying they’re holding a safe Olympics. But everybody knows there is a risk. It’s 100 per cent impossible to have an Olympics with zero risk...of the spread of infection in Japan and also in other countries after the Olympics,"" the Times quoted Oshitani as telling the newspaper.""There are a number of countries that do not have many cases, and a number that don’t have any variants. We should not make the Olympics (an occasion) to spread the virus to these countries,"" he added, noting most countries lack vaccines.Already postponed from last year because of the pandemic, a scaled-down version of the Games with no foreign spectators is set to start on July 23 despite public fears the event could spread the coronavirus and drain medical resources.However, a former Olympian turned public health expert said she believed the Games can be pulled off with an acceptable level of risk.""There will be cases, but having one case or a couple of cases doesn't mean that it was a failure,"" Tara Kirk Sell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Reuters on Tuesday.PRAYING FOR PANDEMIC RELIEFPlaybooks from event organisers detailing testing regimes and movement restrictions for athletes and other visitors ""outline a good strategy"" for minimising contagion, Sell added.Media arriving from abroad to cover the Games will be closely monitored to ensure they don't leave pre-registered areas such as hotels and sports venues, Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto said. She also said Japan's Olympics-related staff were expected to start getting vaccinated in mid-June.  read more ""... we are still in a very difficult situation, but we have seen a gradual decrease of infections in Tokyo, and I am praying that the pandemic is brought under control as swiftly as possible,"" Hashimoto said at the start of a Tokyo 2020 board meeting.Japan has been spared the explosive outbreaks seen elsewhere but has recorded over 760,000 cases and more than 13,600 deaths. Tokyo and other regions are under a state of emergency as the nation battles a fourth wave which is straining hospitals.The government's top medical adviser, Shigeru Omi, said last week medical experts planned a statement on the Games by June 20, when the state of emergency is set to be lifted.A labour union in the northern island of Hokkaido, where the Olympic marathon will be held, petitioned its governor on Monday calling for the Games to be cancelled, media said.Japanese Olympic Committee board member Kaori Yamaguchi, a judo bronze medallist at the 1988 Games, said on Friday Japan  had been ""cornered"" into pressing ahead with the Games.  read more Japan's public remains divided about holding the Games, although opposition appears to be easing somewhat.

How China's vaccine diplomacy brought bosom buddy Cambodia even closer,"Almost one in every five Cambodians has already received a dose of anti-coronavirus vaccine, catapulting the country well past wealthier, bigger Southeast Asian neighbours. Like the doses, the success story is labelled 'Made in China'.Already one of China's closest allies, Cambodia kickstarted inoculations with a bigger donation of vaccines from China than any other country in the region - in addition to Chinese vaccines it had already bought itself.Cambodia's early progress reflects Beijing's vaccine diplomacy in a region where competition with U.S. influence is intense, but has increased concerns among some Cambodians over the closeness of those ties. The United States announced its first major donations to Asia last week.""The question is asked whether Cambodia is too dependent on China,"" authoritarian Prime Minister Hun Sen said in a recent speech. ""If I don't rely on China, whom should I rely on? Without the donations and sales of vaccines from China, we would not have vaccinated the Cambodian people.""Only the wealthy city state of Singapore has made more rapid progress in Southeast Asia relative to population.Some 16% of Cambodia's 16 million people have had at least one vaccine dose, according to official numbers. Close behind are tiny Brunei and then Laos, another state with very close links to Beijing.Much bigger Malaysia and Indonesia had only managed 7.6% and 6.6% respectively, with Thailand on 4.6% and the Philippines 4.2%, according to the latest official data.In Vietnam, where anti-China feeling runs strong, little more than 1% of the population had been covered. Hanoi only approved a Chinese vaccine for emergency use on June 4.""The Cambodian vaccination campaign depends on the use of Chinese vaccines, the road that Hanoi is not willing to take,"" said Nguyen Khac Giang, a PhD candidate at Victoria University of Wellington.'HOLDING HANDS'As Cambodia faced its worst surge of the virus last month, China pledged full support ""which not only embodies the two sides' special friendship but China's responsibility for the China-Cambodia community of a shared future"", China's Global Times quoted foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian as saying.Over 90% of the vaccines Cambodia has used so far are Chinese - from donations totalling 1.7 million doses as of late April, and purchases of 4 million doses from Chinese drugmaker Sinovac. The only other vaccines used have been from the global COVAX programme, set up to assist inoculation in less wealthy countries.""China is the first country to give aid to Cambodia, they let Cambodians get vaccinated and the quality is good,"" said 19-year-old Sinopharm-vaccinated waiter Song Sok Putheara.But he added: ""They help us too much and too often, like they are holding hands and not letting us go.""Still, China's ties with Cambodia have suited both governments.China stepped up aid and investment even as Hun Sen was condemned by Western countries for alleged human rights abuses and the crushing of his political opposition.Meanwhile Cambodia has backed China's position on its extensive claims in the South China Sea against Southeast Asian rivals. It also has growing defence ties - while denying U.S. accusations it is becoming a forward base for China's People's Liberation Army.""Vaccines have become an act of political diplomacy to make and increase Chinese influence in the region, in the world and in Cambodia,"" said Pa Chanroeun, president of the Cambodian Institute for Democracy thinktank.'DEVELOP TRUST'Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, Chinese vaccine donations have not been as generous as in Cambodia, but purchased Chinese vaccines have been vital in Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.Most of the tens of millions of vaccine doses in Indonesia have been made by Chinese companies.The fact that China made its vaccines available on a large scale created a lot of goodwill, said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a foreign policy expert at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences.While it wouldn't erase strains such as those over the South China Sea, it would make a difference, she said.""If you develop co-operation in low security-sensitive areas and then you develop trust then that prevents conflict.

Indian experts urge faster inoculations ahead of free COVID-19 shots,"Indian officials and health experts welcomed a federal government plan to give free COVID-19 shots to all adults as a step in the right direction on Tuesday, but cautioned that vaccinations must be accelerated to prevent new surges in infections.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday the federal government would take over the inoculation programme from Indian states and offer free doses to everyone over the age of 18. His announcement on national television followed weeks of criticism of a vaccine rollout that has covered fewer than 5% of India's estimated adult population of 950 million. This has left the country vulnerable to another wave of infections after a surge in April-May which government data showed killed 170,000.""Took him 4 months but after much pressure, he has finally listened to us and implemented what we've been asking all this while,"" Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal state, wrote on Twitter.India has been giving an average of 2.4 million shots a day. Health officials say this is far from adequate for a country as large as India.""We need to vaccinate 7-8 million persons per day to meet the target of covering all the eligible persons before the end of December,"" Giridhara Babu, a member of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country's main health research agency, told Reuters.Babu is part of the national taskforce's working group on epidemiology and surveillance.Daily infections have fallen and officials aim to switch the focus to mass vaccinations. India reported 86,498 new cases overnight, the lowest number in over two months and a sharp drop from a peak of around 400,000 a day in May.  read more India has been inoculating its people with AstraZeneca (AZN.L) shots produced at the Serum Institute of India, and Covaxin made by Indian firm Bharat Biotech.

Mongolia votes for new president amid COVID-19 campaign curbs,"Mongolia goes to the polls on Wednesday to choose its sixth democratically-elected president, with the ruling Mongolian People’s Party (MPP) on the cusp of consolidating its power following a low-key campaign crimped by COVID-19 curbs.The vote is the first after constitutional amendments stripped the office of some of its powers and limited holders to a single six-year term, so keeping incumbent Khaltmaa Battulga of the opposition Democratic Party from seeking re-election.Ukhnaa Khurelsukh, forced to resign as prime minister after protests this year, is the favourite to take over the presidency for the MPP, which already controls parliament and government.The Democratic Party is fielding Sodnomzundui Erdene to replace Battulga.Campaign events in the capital, Ulaanbaatar, have been kept to a minimum as it battles COVID-19. Daily infections hit a record over the last week and Mongolia's deaths stand at 325.""Because of coronavirus there is very little election campaign information, and I will probably decide at the time,"" said a 22-year-old voter, Ganbayar Gantulga.About 1,000 of Khurelsukh's supporters held a rally outside a concert hall on Saturday, but he moved his campaign online a few hours later after his Labor Party rival Dangaasuren Enkhbat, the third election candidate, tested positive for coronavirus.Mongolia's hybrid political system gives parliament the power to make laws and appoint governments, but it also gives the president a veto over legislation.Voters usually chose opposition party candidates as president. Although winners must relinquish party allegiance, they have tended to block legislation on party lines, creating political deadlock that some say has held back the country.Although businessman and former wrestler Battulgahe failed to overturn the decision to exclude him from this year's elections, he remains popular among some voters.""Battulga has done quite a lot for the people,"" said Tsetsegmaa Khasbat, a 67-year-old retiree.

"In crackdown on fraud from Myanmar, China authorities target suspects' families","Chinese authorities are trying to lure back fugitive fraudsters operating across the border in Myanmar by threatening to cut off pensions and other benefits for family members, according to social media postings by public security bodies.Since a Feb. 1 coup in Myanmar, economic collapse and lawlessness have created conditions for an upsurge in criminal activity, particularly in northern border areas and by Chinese gangs, according to a report from the United States Institute of Peace.Large-scale criminal groups have long operated in the region, much of it outside the control of the military junta, using it as a base for well-organised telecoms and internet fraud scams, as well as hosting illegal casinos.The actions by local authorities come after China's President Xi Jinping said in April that China will resolutely crack down on telecoms and internet fraud.According to notices from Chinese public security departments in at least five counties early this month, suspects in Myanmar face losing their household registration permit - a key document linked to residence and access to public services - if they don't turn themselves in, and would be unable to return to China.One county in Jiangxi province said it would seek to suspend pensions and medical coverage for the immediate relatives of 33 suspects, giving the names and addresses of the suspects. The notice was later deleted from WeChat.A county in Hunan province said social welfare guarantees for family members of suspects would be cancelled, while houses built using illicit funds would be destroyed and the people residing there would be expelled.The official People's Daily WeChat account reposted one of the notices.The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Public Security did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Much of northern Myanmar, where most of the notices said suspects were located, is under the control of militias, some of which are opposed to the military that seized power in a coup in February, while others support it or have remained neutral.""In the two months since the military reestablished its tumultuous rule, criminal activities in Myanmar have widened dramatically, posing new challenges to the region's efforts and ability to control cross-border crime,"" the United States Institute of Peace, a U.S.-government funded nonpartisan institute, said in its April report.Large tracts of northern Myanmar are also part of the Golden Triangle illicit drug producing region, while areas in the north and north-east that border China and Thailand have a proliferation of illegal casinos that law enforcement authorities say are used for money laundering.A television show released in China this year dramatised efforts by the country's police to fight transnational crimes- including telecoms fraud, committed by or against Chinese nationals abroad. One Southeast Asian region called ""Country M"" featured in the drama.In one 2019 telecoms fraud case involving 10 million yuan  ($1.56 million), Chinese police cooperated with their counterparts in northern Myanmar to bring back 69 Chinese nationals, according to the state-backed China Daily.Security experts fear that the collapsing economy and increased fighting between ethnic militias and the Myanmar military in the wake of the coup will see a surge in illicit activity to finance armed groups. The lure of vice will also be strong for those who have lost their jobs or businesses, they add.($1 = 6.3906 Chinese yuan renminbi)Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
French lecturer reaches for stars with astronaut application,"In a break from his job teaching engineering to students in France's Normandy region, Matthieu Pluvinage put the finishing touches on an application for a new job: astronaut.Pluvinage, 38, is taking advantage of a European Space Agency initiative to run an open recruitment drive for new astronauts for its manned flight programme.While he has never been a test pilot or served in the military - typical credentials for astronauts in the past - he ticks many of the boxes in the job description.He has a masters degree in science, he speaks English and French, he reckons he is fit enough to pass the medical, and he has a passion for space.""There are things that make me think, 'I want to do this! It's cool!',"" said Pluvinage in his office at the ESIGELEC engineering school near Rouen, 140 km (90 miles) west of Paris, where he teaches.Pluvinage has a collection of books about Thomas Pesquet, the space engineer and airline pilot who this year became the first French commander of the International Space Station.Displayed on a computer monitor was his job application, still being drafted. He has until June 18 to submit it, and will know the result in October.The odds are long. He has not yet even entered the recruitment process. Competition will be stiff. To succeed, Pluvinage will need to get through six selection rounds.But he said he decided to take the risk because the next time the space agency puts out an open call for new astronauts, likely to be years from now, he may be too old.""No matter the result, if I don't try it, I will have regrets for the rest of my life,"" he said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

"New dinosaur species discovered in Australia, one of world's biggest","Scientists have confirmed the discovery of a new dinosaur species in Australia, one of the largest found in the world, more than a decade after cattle farmers first uncovered bones of the animal.The plant-eating sauropod lived in the Cretaceous period between 92 million and 96 million years ago when Australia was attached to Antartica, according to a research paper published on Monday.Paleontologists estimated the dinosaur reached a height of 5-6.5 metres at the hip and 25-30 metres in length, making it as long as a basketball court and as tall as a two storey building.That makes the new species the largest dinosaur ever found in Australia and puts it in the top five in the world, joining an elite group of titanosaurs previously only discovered in South America.""Discoveries like this are just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Queensland Museum curator and palaeontologist Scott Hocknull.Paleontologists have named the sauropod ""Australotitan cooperensis"", combining ""southern titan"" with the name of a creek near where the first of the creature's bones were found in 2006 on a cattle farming property in Eromanga in Queensland state.The confirmation of the new species marks a seventeen-year long journey to first unearth and then compare the bones of ""Cooper"", as the dinosaur is more informally known, to other finds.1/3Dr. Scott Hocknull and Robyn Mackenzie pose with a 3D reconstruction and the humerus bone of ""Cooper,"" a new species of dinosaur discovered in Queensland and recognised as the largest ever found in Australia, in this undated handout image made available to Reuters on June 8, 2021 in Eromanga, Australia.

Rights panel begins Colombia visit into possible abuses during protests,"Representatives from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (CIDH) met with Colombian officials on Monday ahead of a three-day visit to gather information about possible rights abuses during nearly six weeks of anti-government protests.Dozens of deaths and injuries, many blamed on security forces, were connected to the demonstrations. The death toll of 21 confirmed by the government does not match those of protest groups and rights organizations, which say dozens more were killed.The CIDH, an autonomous arm of the Organization of American States, met with Vice President and Foreign Minister Marta Lucia Ramirez, the human rights ombudsman, attorney general and procurator.The meeting with Ramirez also included Emilio Archila, the top official charged with implementing a 2016 peace deal, who is leading government negotiators at suspended talks with protest leaders.""We had a long and productive meeting, with lots of information, many questions by the commission,"" CIDH President Antonia Urrejola said in remarks with Ombudsman Carlos Camargo.""National human rights institutions like the ombudsman's office are always allies to the commission in their monitoring work and that's why this meeting was so important,"" Urrejola said.Camargo said his office had shared information on the human rights situation during protests.The CIDH will also meet with protest leaders, lawmakers and high court judges and collect testimony from victims of protest violence and their families.Urrejola did not elaborate in a later news conference on what recommendations the CIDH might make following the visit.""Once the visit is over, we will analyze all the information we've received and the listening spaces that were created and next week we will publish a public statement which will contain our observations and recommendations,"" she said.President Ivan Duque has said his government will ask Congress to approve more training and increased oversight of police. An umbrella national strike committee suspended negotiations because the government has not signed a pre-agreement reached late last month.Government negotiators say the pre-agreement was a draft and that the committee unilaterally ended talks, which covered everything from healthcare to a basic income.The government has repeatedly called for the strike committee to condemn road blockades, which have caused shortages and stymied exports.It is not within the remit of the CIDH to comment specifically on the negotiations, Urrejola said, but she urged Colombians to reach solutions through dialogue.Protests and roadblocks have cost the economy close to $3 billion, the Finance Ministry estimates, with barricades halting shipments of oil, coal and coffee, and increasing food prices.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Australia’s Melbourne eyes way out of COVID-19 lockdown as cases ease,"Australia’s Victoria state authorities said plans to ease COVID-19 restrictions in state capital, Melbourne, this week remained “on track” as new locally acquired coronavirus cases declined on Tuesday.Victoria, Australia's second-most-populous state, was plunged into a one-week lockdown on May 27 to contain a virus outbreak, forcing its 7 million residents to remain home except for essential business.The lockdown was extended in Melbourne until June 10, while some restrictions were relaxed in other regions in the state. Two new locally acquired cases, both linked to existing clusters, were reported on Tuesday, down from 11 a day earlier.""While we never want to see new cases, it is reassuring that we are again seeing these cases with clear links to existing outbreaks,"" Victoria state Acting Premier James Merlino told reporters in Melbourne.Merlino said contact tracers have linked the source of the highly infectious Delta virus variant to an overseas traveller who entered hotel quarantine in Melbourne on May 8.But officials said that it was still unclear how the Delta variant was transmitted into the community and that further tests would be needed.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he would like to see the COVID-19 lockdown in Melbourne lifted as early as possible and urged authorities to balance risks when they decide to shut down large parts of the economy.""Further restrictions around the country should either not occur at all, or for a very, very narrow set of circumstances,"" Morrison told reporters in Sydney.Australia has reported zero local cases for most days this year, encouraging authorities to ease restrictions helping the country's A$2 trillion ($1.55 trillion) economy rebound sharply to above pre-pandemic levels.DELTA VARIANTThough case numbers remained in single digits on almost all days through the lockdown, the emergence of the highly contagious Delta variant, first detected in India, late last week had stoked concerns of a major spike in infections.The Delta variant has been classified by the World Health Organization as among the four COVID-19 variants of concern because of evidence that it spreads more easily, and that it most likely caused the latest devastating wave of COVID-19 in India.Australia has fared better than many other developed countries in containing COVID-19, largely with snap lockdowns, regional border restrictions and tough social distancing rules. It has reported just under 30,200 cases and 910 deaths since the pandemic began.The latest outbreak has spurred a surge in people getting inoculated across Australia as federal, state and territory governments look to step up the pace of a sluggish nationwide vaccination drive.New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, on Tuesday said it would build a second mass vaccination hub while South Australia extended its rollout to include people in their 40s.

"Analysis: Iran nuclear deal rescue needs more time, envoys say ahead of fresh talks","A host of barriers to the revival of Iran’s nuclear deal remain firmly in place ahead of talks due to resume this week between Tehran and world powers, suggesting a return to compliance with the 2015 accord is still a way off, four diplomats, two Iranian officials and two analysts say.Iranian demands about sanctions relief and Western concern over Iran's expanding nuclear know-how are among questions that may need weeks or possibly months of further negotiations, the diplomats and analysts said.The talks seek to revive a landmark pact under which Iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions, which opened the way for a brief thaw in decades of U.S.-Iranian confrontation.Then-President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018 saying it was too soft on Tehran, and reimposed sanctions. Iran responded by violating the agreement's limits.Trump's successor Joe Biden has said he wants to restore the deal's nuclear limits and if possible extend them to cover issues such as Iran's regional behaviour and missile programme. Iran wants all sanctions lifted and no expansion of the terms.European Union envoy Enrique Mora, the chief coordinator of the talks, said last week he believed a deal would be reached at the upcoming sixth round of negotiations in Vienna, expected to resume on Thursday or Friday.  read more Adding to the impetus to make progress is an election in Iran on June 18 to replace President Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist who promoted the original deal. He is widely expected to be followed by a hardline successor.The election is not likely to change Tehran's negotiating stance: regardless of who is president any deal must be approved by Iran's hardline faction through Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. But neither Washington nor Tehran wants to start from scratch, or entangle the deal further in Iranian domestic politics.Iran's top nuclear negotiator said last week that barriers to a revival of the deal are complicated but not insurmountable. ""Differences have reached a point where everyone believes these differences are not insolvable,"" Abbas Araqchi said.However, none of the remaining sticking points lend themselves to rapid solutions, according to the diplomats, Iranian officials and analysts of Iranian nuclear matters.Their assessment chimes with downbeat remarks on Monday by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said Washington still did not know whether Iran was ready to resume compliance with the deal. read more ""I doubt that the next round will be the final one... The parties are still far apart on core issues,"" said Ali Vaez, senior Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group.And when, or if, disagreements are solved, more talks would be needed on so-called sequencing - the delicate question of which side takes which action and when, in return for reciprocal steps by the other side, the diplomats said.  read more The negotiations have made considerable progress but are now at the hardest part with the key decisions still needed, said a European diplomat briefed on the talks, which began in April.'THE HEART OF THE MATTER'The talks have arrived at ""the heart of the matter on the nuclear dimension"", a second European diplomat said.A senior Western diplomat said that “of course” he hoped that the next round would result in a deal, but injected a note of caution, saying “until we are able to resolve the important issues that remain, we won’t know.”An Iranian official said: ""Everything depends on Washington. If the American side accepts to lift all sanctions, then Iran will return into full compliance with the deal.""In addition to seeking the lifting of Trump-era sanctions, Tehran also wants Washington to remove Iran's Revolutionary Guards from a terrorism blacklist, which can be used to bar Iranian businesses from the international financial system. It wants Europe to guarantee foreign investors will return, and assurances that Washington will not renege on the deal again.But from the standpoint of Washington and its European allies, it would no longer be sufficient to return to the nuclear restrictions in the orginal deal, designed at the time to ensure that Iran could not build a bomb in less than a year.In the months that Iran has been breaching the limits, it has made technical advances that make the original restrictions out of date. Vaez noted that Iran has begun using advanced centrifuges, known as the IR9, which are 50 times more powerful at producing enriched uranium than the ones covered by the deal, known by its initials as the JCPoA.BREAKOUT TIME""If Iran refuses to destroy these machines, its breakout time will be shorter, unless it agrees to dismantle an equivalent number of IR1 machines. That is seen by Iran as humiliating and beyond the JCPoA's scope,"" Vaez said.The Iranians have acquired knowledge and capabilities they did not have before, said the European diplomat briefed on the talks, citing Iran's first ever production of uranium metal, a material that can be used to make the core of an atom bomb.  read more The development, reported this year by the International Atomic Energy Agency, was not something covered by the 2015 deal, and any revival of the pact would have to take account of this new-found capability, Vaez said.Bob Einhorn, a former senior State Department official and nuclear negotiator with Iran, thought it highly unlikely that there would be an agreement before the presidential election, but conceivable one could be struck during the interim ""lame duck"" period before the new president takes office.Einhorn, now at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, said there could be some political advantage for the new Iranian president to a deal being agreed during the interim.A new president could criticize any concessions made by the current Iranian administration of President Hassan Rouhani, then later take credit for any economic boost the deal produced, he said. “So you could see a kind of logic.”Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Women falling behind in India’s COVID-19 vaccination drive,"Many more men in India have received COVID-19 vaccines than women, government data showed on Tuesday, highlighting gender disparity in the country’s immunisation drive that has also disadvantaged the rural population.India has partly or fully vaccinated about 101 million men, nearly 17% more than women. Men account for 54% of the total number of people inoculated, according to the data.Many federally administered regions, the capital Delhi, and big states such as Uttar Pradesh have seen some of the worst inequities. Only Kerala in the south and Chhattisgarh in central India have vaccinated more women than men.""We are noticing that men, especially in towns and villages, prefer to take the vaccine before women as they have to travel for work, while women are relegated to domestic chores,"" said Prashant Pandya, medical superintendent at a big government hospital in the western state of Gujarat.Health officials say rumours about vaccines disrupting women's menstruation cycle and reducing fertility have also contributed to the skewed data.

The candidate and her hijab: identity matters in French elections,"Laboratory technician Sara Zemmahi was running to be a local councillor backed by President Emmanuel Macron’s ruling party until last month when it withdrew its support. Her transgression: wearing her hijab in a campaign poster.The 26-year-old and the three other candidates who had been on the same ticket are now running as independents in the southern city of Montpellier under the slogan ""Different but united for you"".The affair erupted after the far-right seized upon the image as proof Macron was weak on protecting France's secular values, and propelled Zemmahi into a national row over identity.""We're not giving up,"" Zemmahi said, still wearing her hijab as she distributed campaign fliers in La Mosson, a low-income Montpellier district that is home to generations of Muslim immigrants from France's former north African colonies.In her first interview since she became embroiled in the national debate over the role of Islam in France, Zemmahi said she wanted to focus on promoting equal opportunities and fighting discrimination.""This is my neighbourhood, I was born here. The headscarf wasn't an issue for the four of us.""However, across much of France it is.Zemmahi's campaign photo split Macron's LaRem party, reflecting deep divisions over how secular laws should be applied, notably after Islam emerged as the country's second-biggest religion behind Catholicism.For supporters of a strict interpretation of laïcité, France's version of secularism, Islamic headwear has become a symbol of the politicisation of Islam, subjugation and resistance to the Republic's vision of French identity.Laïcité and identity will be central to the campaign battle ahead of the 2022 presidential vote.

U.S. reunites only seven immigrant children with parents since Feb,"An effort by U.S. President Joe Biden to reunite migrant families separated by the previous administration is moving slowly, with only seven children reunited with parents by a task force launched in February, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) report released on Tuesday.Another 29 families are set to be reunited in the coming weeks, the report said.Biden issued an executive order shortly after taking office that established a task force to reunite children separated from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border under former President Donald Trump, calling such separations a ""human tragedy.""The Trump administration split apart thousands of migrant families under a blanket 'zero-tolerance' policy that called for the prosecution of all unauthorized border crossers in spring 2018. Government watchdogs and advocates have found the separations began before and continued after the policy.The task force submitted its first 120-day progress report to Biden on June 2, a senior DHS official said during a call with reporters on Monday.The official defended the small number of families reunified to date, saying the agency ""chose intentionally to start slow"" to address logistical hurdles so that the process can be scaled up in the future.The Biden task force, using information from advocates and ongoing litigation, has identified roughly 3,900 children separated from parents at the border and 1,700 cases that remain under review, the report said.Of the 3,900 separated children identified, nearly 1,800  have been reunited with a parent. Nearly all of those happened before the creation of the task force, the report said.While the overall number of children still separated from their parents is unknown, the report estimates it could be over 2,000.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"U.N. says 100,000 flee fighting in Myanmar border state","The United Nations said on Tuesday an estimated 100,000 people in Myanmar's Kayah state had been displaced by fighting that included ""indiscriminate attacks by security forces"" in civilian areas.Myanmar has been in turmoil since a military coup on Feb. 1, with daily protests in towns and cities and fighting in borderlands between the military and ethnic minority militias, some of which have only existed for a few weeks.""This crisis could push people across international borders seeking safety, as already seen in other parts of the country,"" the United Nations in Myanmar said in a statement.It urged all parties to ""urgently take the necessary measures and precautions to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure"".Myanmar's foreign minister defended the junta's plan for restoring democracy, state media reported on Tuesday, after a meeting at which his counterparts from ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member states pressed the junta to honour a consensus agreement to halt violence and start dialogue with its opponents.The foreign ministers on Monday expressed disappointment at a meeting in China with Myanmar's ""very slow"" progress in implementing a five-point plan that it agreed to, by consensus, at an ASEAN summit in April.State media cited the junta's envoy, retired army colonel Wunna Maung Lwin, as telling the meeting the military had made progress on its own five-step road map, unveiled after the coup.That plan has few similarities with the ASEAN blueprint and centres on investigating alleged fraud in November's election, managing Myanmar's coronavirus epidemic and organising another election, after which the junta has promised to cede power.CHINA PUSHES ASEAN PLAN""The minister apprised the meeting that the only way to ensure the democratic system that is disciplined and genuine was through the five-point future programme that was declared in February,"" the daily Global New Light of Myanmar reported.The military has defended its takeover by saying that the old election commission ignored its complaints of fraud by Aung San Suu Kyi's ruling party.Wunna Maung Lwin on Tuesday met separately with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, and told him Myanmar was ""committed to maintaining national stability and social tranquillity"", according to a statement by China.He said Myanmar ""appreciates China's support for the peace and reconciliation process"", it said.Wang said the ASEAN plan should be implemented, violence avoided, stability restored and the democratic process restarted, the statement added.Opponents of the junta have been wary of China, one of the few countries that previously had influence over Myanmar's generals. Unlike Western countries, China has not been vocal in criticising the coup.A 'shadow government' named by the opposition was angered by a Chinese Embassy statement that referred to junta head Min Aung Hlaing as ""leader"" of Myanmar.The United Nations, Western countries and China all back ASEAN's effort to mediate in the crisis, which was triggered by the military's decision to end a decade of tentative democracy and international integration that it had itself initiated.But in taking back control, it has been unable to stop protests flaring up and down Myanmar. A rights group says government forces have killed at least 849 protesters, though the army disputes that figure.NEED FOR SHELTER AND FOODThe United Nations on Monday said those who had fled Kayah urgently needed shelter, food, water and healthcare, and urged security forces to let aid workers and supplies through.Kayah, which borders Thailand, is one of several regions where volunteer People's Defence Forces have attacked the well-equipped military, which has responded with heavy weapons and air strikes, triggering an exodus into nearby forests.Thailand, which fears a flood of refugees, has expressed its concern about the fighting and urged the junta to take the steps agreed with ASEAN.Images taken on Monday and obtained by Reuters showed a plume of smoke above the Kayah town of Mobye, which anti-junta militias were forced to flee after the army used heavy weapons, one fighter told Reuters.Reuters is unable to independently verify the accounts. State television made no mention of conflict in Kayah in its nightly newscast and a junta spokesman did not answer several calls seeking comment.Fighting has also taken place in the past few weeks in Demoso, Hpruso and the state capital Loikaw, where a resident described a climate of fear, with troops looting shops and questioning local people.""People are scared to go out,"" said the 25-year-old woman, who asked not to be identified for security reasons.""If people go out, soldiers stop them and interrogate them and sometimes shoot at them.""Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
"Analysis: Peru markets and miners fear Castillo, see silver lining in split vote","Peru’s market and mining watchers are wary of a presidential election victory for socialist Pedro Castillo, who was building a narrow lead on Monday, but see a potential silver lining: a sharply split vote could hinder his plans for dramatic reforms.The leftist candidate has rattled miners and investors since a surprise win in the first-round vote in April, pledging to tear up Peru's decades-old constitution and take up to 70% of profits from firms mining in the country's copper-rich Andes.On Monday the former teacher and union leader held a razor-thin, though growing, lead over his market-friendly conservative rival Keiko Fujimori in the run-off vote. The country's sol currency and equities sank.A final tally may take days to arrive and there could be challenges to the results.""The only positive factor - even if Castillo wins - is that the result of the election shows you that the country is very divided,"" said Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging market strategist at Generali Asset Management.""And with a divided congress it will be very hard for him to implement structural and disruptive reforms.""Whoever wins the presidential vote, Peru will have a deeply fragmented legislature with ten diverse political parties, none of whom hold a majority. Castillo's Free Peru socialists will have the largest bloc, followed by Fujimori's conservatives.Peru's congress has relished clashing with the presidency in the past. Last year, it pushed through a controversial impeachment process against then-President Martin Vizcarra that forced him to step down and sparked deadly protests.Mining firm executives in the country stayed mostly quiet on Monday as they waited for the final outcome.Roque Benavides, chief executive of local miner Buenaventura, told Reuters that miners could agree to things like voluntary contributions to finance local infrastructure projects but more drastic measures like nationalizations would derail investments.""I think that neither of the two candidates can impose their position and therefore I think that the idea of them making dramatic, drastic changes is very debatable,"" he said.Francisco Acuña, a Santiago-based analyst at mining consultancy CRU, said it was quite likely the new government would need to negotiate and reach consensus with companies.""It is evident that the country is torn. Whoever wins, the margin will be minimal,"" he said.RADICAL CHANGESGustavo Medeiros, deputy head of research at emerging market-focused fund manager Ashmore Group, said that a Fujimori presidency would bring less risks of ""populism"" than Castillo, though there was much still unknown about the leftist.""Whoever wins is going to have to govern with a very fragmented congress and that is going to complicate any radical structural legislative changes,"" he said, adding that market weakness from a Castillo win could create a buying opportunity.Castillo said in a statement on Monday evening that if confirmed as president he would respect the central bank's authority and that he was not planning nationalizations or expropriations, but added a tax overhaul on mining was needed to help pay for planned healthcare and education reforms.Julio Ruiz, chief economist for Mexico and Peru at Brazilian bank Itau, said a win for Fujimori - who has pledged to keep in place market-friendly policies that underpinned Peru's economic growth in recent decades - would be more positive for markets.A win for Castillo, said Ruiz, could lead to pressure on the exchange rate and raise the probability that the central bank would hike rates before the end of the year to avoid inflationary pressures.Alejo Czerwonko, Chief Investment Officer for Emerging Markets Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said a Castillo win would lead to a sell-off in Peruvian assets, though he faced challenges turning his rhetoric into reality.""Whether he manages to deliver will depend on how well he navigates the institutional constraints he will face given his party only enjoys 42 out of the 130 seats in congress,"" he said.“Key to watch is whether he is successful in his attempt to push for a constitutional reform.”Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Turkey offers to run Kabul airport after NATO's Afghan withdrawal -officials,"Turkey has offered to guard and run Kabul's airport after the United States and other NATO forces withdraw from Afghanistan, but U.S. officials say Ankara is imposing conditions which need to be resolved as their leaders prepare to meet next week.Turkish officials say Ankara made the proposal at a NATO meeting in May when the United States and its partners agreed a plan to withdraw troops by Sept. 11 after 20 years of war trying to defeat Taliban forces.  read more Turkish and U.S. officials have discussed possible requirements for the mission, some of which Washington has agreed to address, one Turkish official said.""Following the United States' decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, Turkey has made an offer to ensure the security of Kabul airport. In this framework, there are talks underway with NATO and the United States,"" the Turkish official said.A Turkish role securing the airport for international flights could help improve ties between Ankara and the West, sorely strained by Turkey's purchase of Russian defence systems and disputes with European countries over drilling rights in east Mediterranean waters.Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said on Monday that Ankara's offer was contingent on backup from those allies.""We intend to stay in Afghanistan depending on conditions. What are our conditions? Political, financial and logistical support. If these are met, we can remain at Hamid Karzai International Airport,"" his ministry quoted Akar as saying.U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they welcomed the Turkish proposal but that Ankara was asking for too many U.S. ""enablers"" for the mission.The officials also cited some U.S. concern about Turkey's reliability, given their other disagreements, but said Washington would find a way to make it work.NATO leaders will discuss Afghanistan at a summit next Monday, where Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan will meet Joe Biden for the first time since the U.S. president took office.With efforts to resolve the dispute over Turkey's purchase of Russian S-400 missile defences, which led Washington to impose sanctions on Turkey's arms industry last year, the airport plan may offer a rare opportunity to build goodwill.The two countries are also at odds over U.S. support for Syrian Kurdish fighters, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a U.S. court case against a Turkish state bank.ESCALATING VIOLENCEThe proposal comes as clashes over territory in Afghanistan raged, three months before the planned withdrawal. On Monday, senior government officials said at least 150 Afghan troops were killed or injured in a surge of attacks by Taliban militants in the previous 24 hours.Securing Kabul airport could help persuade some countries to maintain a diplomatic presence in Afghanistan. Last month Australia shut its embassy there due to security concerns.Turkey has more than 500 troops stationed in Afghanistan as part of a NATO mission to train Afghan security forces, and the Turkish official said additional troops would be needed for the airport mission.Talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban, which was ousted from power by a U.S. invasion in 2001 and has since waged an insurgency, have been shelved amid the withdrawal. Both sides have accused each other of provocations.The Afghan government and Taliban were not immediately available for comment. It was not clear whether the Islamist Taliban would accept an expanded Turkish mission.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Iran says nuclear talks policy won't change after presidential vote,"Iran's policy in talks with world powers to revive the 2015 nuclear accord will remain unchanged after a June 18 presidential election because the issue is decided by its highest leadership, a government spokesman said on Tuesday.A host of barriers to the revival of the nuclear deal remain firmly in place ahead of talks due to resume this week, suggesting a return to compliance with the accord is still a way off, diplomats, Iranian officials and analysts said.  read more ""We have shown that we adhere to our international obligations under all circumstances, and this was a national decision,"" cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei told a weekly news conference.Rabiei said Iran's nuclear policy, set by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is not linked to internal developments and that the new government would maintain the same policies as those followed in the Vienna talks which began in April.""As long as all parties to the nuclear accord abide by their commitments, they can be sure that Iran will not abandon its obligations,"" Rabiei said.Former U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018, prompting Iran to steadily overstep the accord's limits on its nuclear programme.With a hardline-led election watchdog barring leading moderate and conservative candidates, the turnout is likely to be low in seven-man race between hardline and somewhat less hardline candidates, and two low-profile moderates.The candidates took part in a televised debate on Tuesday and sparred on issues including ways of saving the nuclear deal and lifting U.S. sanctions that have devastated Iran's economy.The leading moderate candidate, Abdolnaser Hemmati, accused hardliners of seeking to heighten tensions with the West through a militant foreign policy, while conglomerates they control rake in large sums by circumventing sanctions.""I face a tendency which wants to turn the White House into a Hosseinieh (Shi'ite prayer hall) instead of developing Iran,"" said Hemmati, a former central bank chief.

We have yet to receive evidence to support these claims,"" the AP said in a statement.""AP continues to call for the full release of any evidence the Israelis have so that the facts are public.""In a statement, Erdan reiterated an Israeli claim that the building housed Hamas military intelligence, saying its personnel there were ""developing an electronic jamming system to be used against the Iron Dome defense system"".Israel's Iron Dome interceptors shot down most of the more than 4,300 rockets fire from Gaza during the 11-day conflict, during which Israeli air strikes and Gaza rocket fire left more than 250 Palestinians and 13 in Israel dead.The Israeli military said the purpose of the strike ""was to curtail these enemy capabilities, including destroying special equipment, and preventing their use during the operation...The strike was designed to collapse the building in order to ensure the destruction of the special means.""Erdan said Israel did all it could to avoid civilian harm.""AP is one of the most important news agencies in the world and Israel doesn't think that AP employees were aware it was being cynically used in this way by Hamas for a secret unit,"" he said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
World Bank opposes vaccine intellectual property waiver as WTO talks resume,"World Bank President David Malpass said on Tuesday the bank does not support waiving intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization out of concern that it would hamper innovation in the pharmaceuticals sector.His comments on the subject, made during a call with reporters on World Bank economic forecasts, came as WTO negotiations over the proposed waiver resumed in Geneva.Asked whether he backs a WTO vaccine IP waiver, which India, South Africa and other emerging market countries argue is needed to expand vaccine access, Malpass said: ""We don't support that, for the reason that it would run the risk of reducing the innovation and the R&D in that sector.""The comment puts Malpass, a Trump administration nominee, at odds with the Biden administration, which is supporting text-based WTO negotiations for vaccine intellectual property rights, led by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai.Major vaccine makers and the pharmaceutical industries have opposed the waiver from the WTO's agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), arguing that it would stifle innovation and do little to effectively increase vaccine supplies constrained by trade barriers, shortages of components and a lack of manufacturing capabilities.Malpass on Tuesday reiterated his calls for wealthy countries to quickly donate their excess vaccine doses to the developing world as quickly as possible.  read more The World Bank said its global growth forecasts, raised to 5.6% for 2021 and 4.3% for 2022, could be higher if vaccinations can be accelerated in developing countries.  read more In Geneva, negotiations were proceeding on Tuesday and Wednesday over revised waiver proposals from India and South Africa that remained far broader than the narrow vaccine-only waiver favored by USTR Tai.""It seems to be they are still far apart.

U.S. to Iran: mess with IAEA monitoring and put talks on deal at risk,"The United States told Iran on Tuesday that it must let the U.N. atomic agency continue to monitor its activities, as laid out in an agreement that has been extended until June 24, or put wider talks on reviving the Iran nuclear deal at risk.The International Atomic Energy Agency and Iran reached a three-month agreement in February cushioning the blow of Tehran's decision to reduce its cooperation with the agency by ending extra monitoring measures introduced by the 2015 deal.  read more Under that new side agreement, which on May 24 was extended by a month, data continues to be collected in a black-box-type arrangement, with the IAEA only able to access it at a later date.

Spy phones 'in gangsters' back pockets' betray hundreds to police,"A global sting in which organised crime gangs were sold encrypted phones that law enforcement officials could monitor has led to more than 800 arrests and the confiscation of drugs, weapons, cash and luxury cars, officials said on Tuesday.The operation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Australian and European police ensnared suspects in Australia, Asia, Europe, South America and the Middle East involved in the narcotics trade, the officials said.Millions of dollars in cash were seized in raids around the world, along with 30 tonnes of drugs including more than eight tonnes of cocaine.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the operation had ""struck a heavy blow against organised crime – not just in this country, but ... around the world"".Operation Greenlight/Trojan Shield, conceived by Australian police and the FBI in 2018, was one of the biggest infiltrations and takeovers of a specialised encrypted network.It began when U.S. officials paid a convicted drug trafficker to give them access to a smartphone that he had customised, on which he was installing ANOM, also styled An0m, a secure encrypted messaging app. The phones were then sold to organised crime networks through underworld distributors.The FBI helped to infiltrate 12,000 devices into 300 criminal groups in more than 100 countries, Calvin Shivers of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division told reporters in The Hague.On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced the indictment of 17 suspected distributors for their involvement in marketing and selling thousands of the ANOM devices to transnational criminal organizations.All defendants are foreign nationals outside the United States and eight of them were arrested on Tuesday, said Randy Grossman, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California at a press conference in San Diego. The others remain at large.The indictment accuses the defendants of knowing that the devices they distributed were being used by criminals to coordinate drug trafficking and money laundering, Grossman said.""Today marks a culmination of more than five years of strategic, innovative, complex investigative work to disrupt and dismantle encrypted communication services that cater to the criminal element across the globe,"" said Suzanne Turner, special agent in charge of the San Diego FBI field office.COCAINE IN FRUITIn a pattern repeated elsewhere, one Australian underworld figure began distributing phones containing the app to his associates, believing their communications were secure because the phones had been rebuilt to remove all capabilities, including voice and camera functions, apart from ANOM.As a result, there was no attempt to conceal or code the details of the messages - which police were reading.""It was there to be seen, including 'we’ll have a speedboat meet you at this point', 'this is who will do this' and so on,"" Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said.""We have been in the back pockets of organised crime ... All they talk about is drugs, violence, hits on each other, innocent people who are going to be murdered.""The phones were such a hit that Italian mafiosi, Asian triads, biker gangs and transnational drug syndicates all began using them, providing the FBI and its partner forces around the world with a trove of 27 million messages.Shivers said the FBI had been able to see photographs of ""hundreds of tons of cocaine that were concealed in shipments of fruit"".PRINTERS FOR GUN PARTSAustralian police said they had arrested 224 people, including members of outlawed motorcycle gangs, and disrupted 21 murder plots.On Monday alone, they seized 104 firearms, including a military-grade sniper rifle, as well as almost A$45 million ($35 million) in cash, including A$7 million from a safe buried under a garden shed in a suburb of Sydney.In Europe, there were 49 arrests in the Netherlands, 75 in Sweden and over 60 in Germany, where authorities seized hundreds of kilograms of drugs, more than 20 weapons and over 30 luxury cars and cash.Finnish police not only detained almost 100 suspects and seized 500 kg of narcotics but also found a warehouse with 3-D printers used to manufacture gun parts.The operation also revealed that gangs were being tipped off about police actions, which prompted ""numerous high-level public corruption cases in several countries"", according to an affidavit from an FBI agent.  read more Kershaw said the Australian underworld figure, who had absconded, had ""essentially set up his own colleagues"" by distributing the phones, and was now a marked man.""The sooner he hands himself in, the better for him and his family.""

"Mladic verdict reveals Bosnia's divisions, lack of reconciliation","Survivors and relatives of victims of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre breathed a sigh of relief on Tuesday after U.N. war crimes judges upheld the genocide conviction and life sentence of former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic.""We have been anxious about what will happen for the past month but we are pleased. Thank God it's over,"" said Mida Osmanovic, after watching with other women a public broadcast of the court's verdict at the Srebrenica Memorial Centre.""It gives us some satisfaction but even more distress,"" Osmanovic added, recalling how it made her relive her experiences 26 years earlier.She and other women who lost their male relatives in the massacre considered Europe's worst atrocity since World War Two  walked among the 6,600 white tombstones at Srebrenica cemetery marking the graves of their murdered relatives.""The majority of my family is here,"" Osmanovic said pointing to the tombstones.Mladic, 78, who led Bosnian Serb forces during Bosnia's 1992-95 war, had appealed against his 2017 conviction on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes and his life sentence but the appeals chamber dismissed his appeal and affirmed the sentence of life imprisonment.The verdict caps 25 years of trials at the ad hoc International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which convicted 90 people for the crimes committed in the Bosnian war in which about 100,000 died and 2 million were displaced.But Bosnia's Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats still see the war through opposing lenses.Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik, who is currently chairing Bosnia's tripartite inter-ethnic presidency, criticised the judgement as unfair, saying the ICTY was biased against Serbs and its rulings undermined the trust in international justice.""It's clear to us there is an attempt here to create a myth about genocide in Srebrenica which has never occurred,"" Dodik said.Most Serbs deny that genocide happened and say that Mladic was a Serb defender and a hero.""I think the Hague tribunal has been probably designed from the beginning as a court that would a priori judge one side, that is us ... and I simply do not expect any justice, nothing,"" said Bojan Stojnic, an economist, in Banja Luka, the largest Bosnian Serb city.But Muslim Bosniaks, who suffered the greatest losses in the 1992-95 war, welcomed the ruling.""It is important that his crimes from the last war have been  named before the whole world,"" said Sefik Dzaferovic, the Bosniak member of the country's presidency.

Samoa's disputed leader promises Chinese-backed port at a third of the cost,"Samoa's disputed leader is promising to build a port with Chinese help for $100 million, about a third of the cost proposed earlier, said sources with knowledge of the initial plan, as he bids to stay in power despite losing a parliamentary majority in a tight election.The Asian Development Bank (ADB) deemed that the port project at Vaiusu, west of the capital Apia, was not economically viable after it was estimated it would cost more than $300 million, sources told Reuters.But the project's chief supporter, long-serving leader Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, told parliament recently a reworked version of the ""China-funded project"" would cost 250 million tala ($96.9 million) to build.Tuilaepa, a long-term ally of China, said the new port would create much-needed jobs and boost trade and tourism, while overcoming weaknesses at the main port in Apia, which is vulnerable to ocean swell.Opposition leader Fiame Naomi Mataafa, who was sworn-in as prime minister at an ad-hoc ceremony in May, told Reuters she would shelve the port development, calling it excessive for a small country already heavily indebted to China.  read more China has in recent years become a more assertive competitor for influence in the Pacific with the United States and its allies, which are wary of Chinese-backed infrastructure projects that could support military activity in hostile times in the strategic waters.Tuilaepa has not disclosed what financing arrangements have been discussed with China and which contractors may be involved. A spokesman for Tuilaepa did not respond to questions.The ADB said in a statement to Reuters that it found in a 2015 study that the Vaiusu plan was ""not economically and financially viable"".It instead recommended upgrading the existing Apia port, where work has been done with aid from Japan.The ADB declined to disclose costing data for the Vaiusu option.Three sources with direct knowledge of the ADB study, including one diplomatic official, told Reuters the Vaiusu project was projected to cost more than $300 million, raising concern it could tip Samoa into unsustainable debt should it go ahead.One of the sources said Samoa had sought help from China after the ADB declined to support the project.'NO STRINGS'The China-backed plan has a different wharf location, which reduces the amount of dredging required, compared with the ADB plan, thereby lowering costs. But one of the sources said that it was not clear how the new projected price could be reduced by two-thirds.The Vaiusu port would cater for container vessels, cruise ships and shipping fleets, and is in the final stages of negotiation with China with work set to begin when coronavirus restrictions on international borders are lifted, according to a January report in the Samoa Observer, citing Tuilaepa.China's foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, told a regular briefing in Beijing in May that Samoa had asked China to conduct a feasibility study for the port, and that any help would come ""without any political strings"".  read more China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to additional questions on Wednesday.China is the single largest creditor in Samoa, a country of 200,000 people, accounting for about 40%, or some $160 million, of its external debts.Samoa, meanwhile, has been at a political impasse since its April election.While a series of judicial rulings back Fiame's claim to be prime minister, Tuilaepa retains the support of the head of state, who has suspended parliamentary hearings and frustrated plans to confirm a new government.  read more The United Nations has urged Samoa's leaders to resolve the crisis through dialogue.($1 = 2.5694 tala)Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

U.N. rights envoy warns of risk of starvation in Myanmar's Kayah State,"Myanmar's Kayah State could suffer a ""massive"" loss of life beyond anything seen since the military seized power, with more than 100,000 people fleeing their homes to escape conflict, a U.N. human rights investigator warned on Wednesday.Myanmar's military has been battling on multiple fronts to impose order since its Feb. 1 coup against Aung San Suu Kyi and her elected government sparked nationwide protests.Kayah State, which borders Thailand, is one of several regions where volunteer People's Defence Forces have clashed with Myanmar's well-equipped army, which has responded with artillery and air strikes, triggering an exodus into nearby forests.""The junta's brutal, indiscriminate attacks are threatening the lives of many thousands of men, women and children in Kayah State,"" Thomas Andrews, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said in a statement.""Let me blunt. Mass deaths from starvation, disease, and exposure, on a scale we have not yet seen since the February 1 coup, could occur in Kayah State absent immediate action,"" he said.An activist in Kayah State said many displaced people could not be reached including in an area east of Demoso town, about 15 km (9 miles) from the state capital, Loikaw.""Some people to the east of Demoso have to survive on rice broth as we cannot deliver rice bags to them,"" said the activist, who asked not to be identified. She said that military authorities had arrested three people trying to deliver aid in the last two weeks.Power had also been cut in many areas and, along with food, materials for shelter and petrol were also desperately needed, said the activist, who also called for urgent international help.A spokesman for the junta did not immediately respond to calls requesting comment.Thailand, which fears a flood of refugees, has expressed its concern about the fighting in Myanmar and urged the junta to take steps agreed with other Southeast Asian countries aimed at setting a course out of the conflict.The junta has paid little heed to demands from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to respect a ""consensus"" agreed in late April to end violence and hold political talks with its opponents.A rights group says Myanmar security forces have killed at least 857 protesters since the coup, though the army disputes that figure.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Philippine military chief visits island in disputed waters,"The head of the Philippine armed forces visited a coral-fringed island his country occupies in the South China Sea this week, a move that could stoke already heightened tensions between Manila and Beijing in disputed waters claimed by both countries.During Monday's visit, Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief Cirilito Sobejana commended the soldiers for the role they played in protecting the island's residents and ""guarding the country's territories"" in the strategic waterway.The visit comes after recent diplomatic protests made by the Philippines over what it says is the illegal presence of hundreds of ""Chinese maritime militia"" vessels inside its exclusive economic zone and near its occupied islands.Chinese diplomats have said the boats were just sheltering from rough seas and no militia were aboard.Sobejana's trip to Thitu, known to Filipinos as Pagasa, happened on Monday, but information was only made public by the AFP on Wednesday.Thitu is the biggest of the nine reefs, shoals and islands the Philippines occupies in the Spratly archipelago, and is home to a small number of military personnel and civilians.""(The troops) are in very high spirit, their level of moral is high especially after our visit,"" Sobejana told reporters on Tuesday evening, adding he also wanted to inspect the island to oversee plans to convert it into a logistics hub to make it easier for naval assets conducting patrols to refuel.The Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Philippines, Brunei, China, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam have competing claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea, a conduit for goods in excess of $3 trillion every year.The foreign ministers of Southeast Asia and China agreed during a meeting on Monday to exercise restraint in the South China Sea and avoid actions that could escalate tensions.  read more Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

The government says the nurses' demands amounted to a 17% increase that it can't afford, but pledged to continue negotiations.The stand-off comes as Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern faces criticism for not doing enough to address rising inequality, despite the economy bouncing back from the COVID-19 pandemic more swiftly than expected.Thousands of nurses marched on the streets holding placards, while others gathered at parks and outside hospitals around the country.""Nurses are the glue who hold care services together,"" Dr Julian Vyas, president of Association of Salaried Medical Specialists said, according to online news portal Newshub.""If they are on strike, you can be sure there's a big problem which needs to be fixed,"" he added.Nurses have complained of being underpaid and burnt out, with conditions worsening with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic.Current pay rates do not attract people into the profession or retain the people, and staffing levels have stretched them to breaking point, putting them and their patients at risk, NZNO has said in a statement.""""We stood during the pandemic.

Singapore's death toll from COVID-19 tops casualties in SARS outbreak,"Singapore has reported its 34th death due to COVID-19, taking its toll from the pandemic beyond the 33 casualties recorded during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak.The city-state was one of the worst-hit countries by SARS outside mainland China, based on numbers of infection and death, according to the World Health Organization's data.SARS, a previously unknown infectious disease, is believed to have emerged from the wet markets of China's Guangdong province before spreading into major cities. Globally, as many as 774 people died in the epidemic that reached nearly 30 countries.While the current pandemic death toll has exceeded Singapore's death toll from the SARS outbreak, the city-state still has one of the world's lowest COVID-19 fatality rates.Singapore authorities had said at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that the experience dealing with SARS meant they were more prepared for the COVID-19 outbreak.So far, Singapore has reported 62,219 COVID-19 infections since January last year, while it recorded 238 SARS cases between March and May 2003.The 34th COVID-19 death in Singapore was an 86-year-old woman who had not been vaccinated against COVID-19 and had a history of comorbidities including diabetes and hypertension, Singapore's health ministry said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
Mexico bans influential ex-minister from holding public office,"A former Mexican senior Cabinet minister, Luis Videgaray, has been banned from holding jobs or positions in public service for 10 years for failing to properly disclose his assets while in office, the Mexican government said on Tuesday.The Public Administration Ministry (SFP) said it had applied the maximum possible sanction against Videgaray for making incorrect declarations for three years running during his time as finance minister and later as foreign minister.Videgaray, who was widely viewed as the most influential minister under Mexico's previous president, Enrique Pena Nieto, denied that he had made improper disclosures, saying on Twitter that he would appeal against the decision.Videgaray, who has rejected any allegations of wrongdoing, said in a statement the SFP had identified omissions in his asset declarations relating to bank accounts.Videgaray said these were in fact credit cards which he had mentioned in an annex to his declarations, and they had no outstanding debts on them at the time.""The declarations are correct and there was no intention to hide information about assets from the SFP,"" he said, adding that the SFP had acknowledged in the notification sent to him that he had obtained ""no benefit"" from the alleged omissions.The SFP later responded to Videgaray's remarks, saying that the omissions were bank accounts, which contained sums of money that should have been declared.The SFP said it had opened a probe in 2019 into Videgaray over his possible involvement in the 2014 purchase by state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) of a fertilizer plant known as AgroNitrogenados, which later caused a scandal.Asked publicly in February 2020 about his role in scandals in Mexico, including investigations relating to Pemex, Videgaray said that he had done good things and made mistakes as a policymaker, but that he stood by his track record. Videgaray was notified of the sanction on May 11, but the news was not made public until now due to the campaign for mid-term elections, which were held on Sunday, the SFP said.Mexico's government argues the plant deal wasted millions of dollars in public money and was tainted by corruption.The acquisition of AgroNitrogenados forms part of a broader investigation by federal prosecutors into allegations of graft under the Pena Nieto administration.President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador accuses the preceding administration of scheming to case the break up of Pemex to benefit private interests.The SFP said the sanction handed down against Videgaray was independent of any other investigations that may be under way.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
